The data, based on in-depth interviews with 17 adolescents, revealed that the care situation induces both positive and negative changes in family relationships. On the one hand, adolescents showed considerable empathy and respect for the parent who is the primary caregiver and reported that joint involvement in caregiving enhances adolescent–parent bonds. On the other hand, the adolescents lamented restrictions on their own and the family unit''s activities due to the care situation. They also complained about spillover of caregiver stress on other family relationships and about parent-caregivers'' focus of attention on the care recipient.

We present a simple model of aid and public expenditure in which public infrastructure generates an inter-temporal productivity spillover which may exhibit a sector-specific bias. The model also provides for a learning-by-doing externality, through which total factor productivity in the tradable sector is an increasing function of past export volumes. We then use an extended version of this model, calibrated to contemporary conditions in Uganda, to simulate the effect of a step increase in net aid flows. Our simulations show that beyond the short-run, where conventional demand-side Dutch disease effects are present, the relationship between enhanced aid flows, real exchange rates, output growth and welfare is less straightforward than simple models of aid suggest. We show that public infrastructure investment which generates a productivity bias in favour of non-tradable production delivers the largest aggregate return to aid, but it does so at the cost of a deterioration in the income distribution. Income gains accrue predominantly to urban skilled and unskilled households, leaving the rural poor relatively worse off.

In the case of pathogens that use bats as reservoirs, a common route seems likely. Bats' feeding habits are constrained by the aerodynamics of flight, so they can not ingest huge amounts of food. Yet many bats are frugivorous, that is, they meet their energy requirements by ingesting fruits. The animal pens of the pig farms where the Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia was first reported were littered with partially digested fruits that were regurgitated from bats.

In the simple model of aid and public expenditure presented here, public infrastructure generates an intertemporal productivity spillover, which may exhibit a sector-specific bias. The model also provides for a learning-by-doing externality, through which total factor productivity in the tradable sector is an increasing function of past export volumes. An extended computable version of this model is used to simulate the effect of a step increase in net aid flows. The simulations show that beyond the short run, when conventional demand-side Dutch disease effects are present, the relationship between enhanced aid flows and real exchange rates, output growth, and welfare is less straightforward than simple models of aid suggest. Public infrastructure investment that generates a productivity bias in favor of nontradable production delivers the largest aggregate return to aid, but at the cost of a deterioration in the income distribution.

Due to its highly contagious nature, it is considered to be the most devastating livestock disease. Its outbreaks result in a loss of export markets by an infected country and present significant containment and eradication costs. Governmental agencies provide inspection and quarantine services prior to outbreak (ex ante) to prevent the introduction of the disease across national borders and enforces eradication policies following an outbreak (ex post). This research presents two models to analyze both ex ante and ex post decisions of FMD control, and an empirical application to the data on FMD outbreaks of the information theoretic estimators. The first paper presents how location, spatial spillover effects, trade, and different control incentives across borders might prevent complete eradication of FMD outbreaks and undermine the potential success of disease control programs. Border inspection is crucial to protect the domestic livestock industry against incursion of the disease. A spatial game theoretic framework is applied to compare disease control strategies chosen under centralized and decentralized decision models for a cluster of spatially adjacent countries. The results show that spatial spillover effects are ignored and socially inferior control strategies are chosen under decentralized decision model. The probability of outbreak is smaller and the socially optimal levels of control effort and expected payoffs are greater under centralized decision model. Intervention might be required to change individual payoffs to incorporate spatial interactions and efficiently mitigate FMD outbreaks. The second paper evaluates alternative mitigation measures following an outbreak in a stochastic optimal control bioeconomic-epidemiological model under uncertainty of a potential entry and spread of the disease. The conceptual model captures the intertemporal welfare impacts of mitigation measures and integrates dynamic livestock production, disease dissemination, domestic consumption, and international trade. The model is applied to the case of a hypothetical outbreak in Canada. Since Canada exports around 50% of its beef production, a potential outbreak is a major policy concern. The mitigation scenarios including stamping-out, movement controls, and preemptive slaughter are evaluated. Results show that, under stamping-out and movement controls mitigation measures, as the level of preemptive slaughter increases from 30% to 90% of latent infectious cattle, the total welfare loss from an outbreak decreases from $171 billion to $16 billion. The third paper proposes a generalized information theoretic estimator for the regression model with the first order spatial autoregression in the dependent variable. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments are used to compare finite sample performance of traditional and three information theoretic estimators including maximum empirical likelihood, maximum empirical exponential likelihood, and maximum log Euclidean likelihood. Finite sample performance of Wald, Likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier tests constructed from these estimators is examined. It is found that information theoretic estimators are robust to specification of spatial autocorrelation and outperform traditional estimators in finite samples. Finally, the estimators are applied to an illustrative example of FMD outbreaks.",Dissertation,,,Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; Biofuels; Agricultural Extension Services,English,eng,,,Invasive Species Outbreaks and International Trade,Ph.D.,Washington State University,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1075515&site=ehost-live

In this paper, we argue that the concerns about current public health IS projects are partially rooted in the lack of a comprehensive framework that captures the complexity of EID management to inform and evaluate the development of public health IS. We leverage loose coupling to analyze news coverage and contact tracing data from 479 patients associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan. From this analysis, we develop a framework for outbreak management. Our proposed framework identifies two types of causal circles—coupling and decoupling circles—between the central public health administration and the local capacity for detecting unusual patient cases. These two circles are triggered by important information-centric activities in public health practices and can have significant influence on the effectiveness of EID management. We derive seven design guidelines from the framework and our analysis of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan to inform the development of public health IS.

In recent years, a growing number of papers have considered the role of physical geography as a determinant of regional growth and development by considering it as a source of ""intrinsic advantage"". Malaria is considered to be strictly related to poverty and its geographically-related origin is now widely recognized, i.e. it is endemic only in certain areas of the globe whose environmental and climatic characteristics are ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes which are the vector for the transmission of the disease. The World Health Organization is currently setting a series of policies aiming to eradicate the disease from Africa, with the specific goals to preserve human lives and possibly to boost economic growth in those areas. Among the several malaria parasites, the worst, Plasmodium falciparum, has infested Italian regions for centuries until the complete eradication occurred in the period 1945-1950. In this paper I provide an empirical assessment of the economic outcomes of malaria eradication in Italian regions. By making use of both macroeconomic and microeconomic data, I found support to the hypothesis that malaria eradication boosts productivity growth and that in the long run it leads to an increase in human capital. In particular, I found that the presence of malaria reduced significantly regional growth over the period 1891-1961, while its eradication increased the years of schooling for both males and females respectively, although my evidence points at a larger support for a very long run impact of eradication actions through an intergenerational spillover effect.",Working Paper,,,Demographic Economics: General,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1155481&site=ehost-live

The first essay titled ""Fundamental Sources of Long-run Labour Productivity Improvements in Canada"" examines the importance of the public infrastructure as a source of growth in labour productivity in the Canadian economy within the last four decades. Time series data are used to develop an econometric model to capture the interaction among labour productivity, R&D investments, the public infrastructure, and trade openness. Extensive tests of data quality, choice of model, and stability of the model are performed to enrich the research. The results suggest that the type of capital involved has a significant effect on the extent of labour productivity and growth. Innovation, the major characteristic of a knowledge-based economy, improves labour productivity both in the short and long run. The effect of trade openness is also discussed in depth. The second paper titled ""Competition and Innovation with Horizontal R&D Spillovers"" extends a theoretical framework for analyzing competition and innovation in presence of horizontal spillovers. Introducing two scenarios, it is shown that when firms behave non-cooperatively in both the R&D and production stages, (i) the degree of spillover has a negative relationship with the effective and respective R&D expenditures of each firm as well as the level of social welfare; (ii) the relationship between the number of firms and the respective and effective R&D expenditure of each firm is negative. It also has a negative relationship with the level of social welfare: an inverted-U relationship when the benefits of R&D are low and a steady negative relationship when R&D technology is very productive. When firms behave cooperatively in the R&D stage, and non-cooperatively in the production stage, (i) the relationship between the R&D expenditure of the joint research lab and the number of firms in the market is negative, and (ii) in the limit, there would be no innovation in the market when the number of firms tends to infinity. It is also shown that when there are more than one firm in the market, allowing them to cooperate in the R&D stage, but not in the production stage, yields a level of social welfare that is higher than the social welfare level obtained when the firms behave non-cooperatively in both stages of the game. The third paper titled ""The Search for New Drugs: A Theory of R&D in the Pharmaceutical Industry"" formalizes, in a rigorous manner, the concept of information externalities, by modeling R&D activities as the process of searching for a drug to treat a disease, with R&D activities being modeled from the perspective of the theory of optimal search. In conventional models of patent design, only one brand--the brand with the highest quality--is available on the market at any time. Furthermore, demand is completely inelastic: each consumer, regardless of income and regardless of the price of the brand offered on the market, buys exactly one unit of the brand. In this model, which is a dynamic model in continuous time, several differentiated products--the products whose patents are still in force and the products whose patents have expired--are available at any time on the market. Furthermore, the demand for a brand depends on income, its own price, and the prices of the other brands. The analyses of R&D as well as the impact of the cost and the quality of newly discovered drugs on the market are represented under this framework, when the pharmaceutical firms with an active drug discovery program behave strategically in both R&D and in the product market.",Dissertation,,,Macroeconomics: Production,English,eng,,,Three Essays on R&D Investment,Ph.D.,University of Ottawa,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1336043&site=ehost-live

More than 100,000 individuals in the United States are currently on the organ transplant waiting list, yet surprisingly little is known about the factors that affect organ donation rates. In order to increase our knowledge about the supply of transplantable organs, this paper assesses the effects of economic conditions on deceased organ donations. Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, I estimate that a 1 percentage-point decrease in the unemployment rate is associated with a 3.5 percent increase in the supply of organ donors killed in motor vehicle accidents. Despite evidence of strong cyclical patterns in deaths involving cerebrovascular disease, suicides, and homicides, no correlation was found between the unemployment rate and organ donation rates for these causes of death. Understanding cyclical fluctuations in donations will help policy makers and transplant specialists design policies aimed at increasing the supply of organs by enhancing their knowledge of expected donors. Chapter 2 is titled ""Donorcycles: Motorcycle Helmet Laws and the Supply of Organ Donors"" (with Stacy Dickert-Conlin and Todd Elder). Traffic safety mandates are typically designed to reduce the harmful externalities of risky behaviors. We consider whether motorcycle helmet laws also reduce a beneficial externality by decreasing the supply of viable organ donors. Our central estimates show that organ donations resulting from fatal motor vehicle accidents increase by 10 percent when states repeal helmet laws. Two features of this association suggest that it is causal: first, nearly all of it is concentrated among men, who account for over 90 percent of all motorcyclist deaths, and second, helmet mandates are unrelated to the supply of donors who die in circumstances other than motor vehicle accidents. The estimates imply that every death of a helmetless motorcyclist prevents or delays as many as 0.33 deaths among individuals on organ transplant waiting lists. Chapter 3 is titled ""Not on My Backroads: A Study of Spillover Effects in Motorcycle Helmet Legislation"". Previous research on the effectiveness of motorcycle helmet laws has found a roughly 30% increase in fatalities following the repeal of a universal helmet law. This study examines how motorcycle helmet laws in neighboring states affect fatality rates. Adjacent states with different laws create incentives for motorcyclists from both states to avoid the helmet mandate by riding in the state with the more lenient law.

Despite the scale of this threat, there are inherent limitations in preventing and controlling EIDs, including the scope of current disease surveillance efforts. All of this leads to the following questions in the context of Mexico's recent swine flu experience: What were the cultural, political, and economic challenges to Influenza A/H1N1 virus response in Mexico? By way of comparison, what can we learn from the U.S. experience in 1976 with A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1), later referred to as H1N1? This article explores the comparative political economy of Mexico's handling of influenza virus A/H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Research provides notable observations -- based on the strengths and weaknesses of each country's response -- that can be used as a starting point of discussion for the design of effective EIDs surveillance programs in developing and middle-income countries. In the U.S., the speed and efficiency of the 1976 U.S. mobilization against H1N1 was laudable. Although the U.S. response to the outbreak is seldom praised, the unity of the scientific and political communities demonstrated the national ability to respond to the situation.

From this, we examine the policy responses implemented to better manage risk, and conclude by identifying the current gaps in the decision process related to risk and uncertainty, which is a reflection of imperfect knowledge. Recent advances in our modeling frameworks have helped streamline the complex decision space faced by policymakers and improved our understanding of the risks and consequences of mitigation strategies.

To illustrate our arguments, we refer to the extent of regional cooperation for health in ASEAN and the EU for (re)emerging infectious disease control and for tobacco control. We argue that regional institutions and a network of civil society organizations are crucial in relaying global initiatives, and ensuring the effective implementation of global guidelines at the national level.

The first essay begins by exploring the role of a recent diagnosis of diabetes on the dynamics of several health investment behaviors in older Americans, including smoking, alcohol use, frequent exercise, and the outcome of overweight or obese status. Nine waves of longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study are used. The behavioral response of diagnosed diabetics is compared to a group of individuals who are statistically likely to have high blood sugar levels based on Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. A population average probit model, estimating using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) framework, is used to clarify this relationship. While individuals tend to respond initially by increasing exercise levels and decreasing weight, cigarette and alcohol consumption, the response decreases with time and recidivism is present after initial diagnosis, especially through reduced exercise levels and weight gain. Essays two and three examine family-related (and more specifically, father-related) determinants of child and maternal health outcomes. The second essay uses panel data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to explore how childhood family structure through age 15 (as measured by biological father absence and other male entrance) affects physical and mental health outcomes (including self-reported health status, overweight or obesity status, and depression) smoking behavior during adolescence (Wave I), as well as subsequently into young adulthood (Waves II through IV). Static logit models are estimated to assess the role of family structure on adolescent health outcomes and smoking, whereas discrete-time hazard models are used to estimate changes in these outcomes (e.g.,quitting or starting smoking) after adolescence. These models are estimated separately for boys and girls. Results suggest that while most of the effect of family structure occurs during adolescence, there are residual effects of paternal absence in later life that can discourage smoking and reporting favorable health outcomes. Finally, the third essay uses panel data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) are used to test the hypothesis that increased father involvement as measured through any child support, informal support, in-kind support, and father-child contact (i.e., visitation) can have spillover effects on the mother's mental health, as measured by depression. Maternal depression is an important outcome to consider as it is highly prevalent (especially in families headed by a single mother). Pooled linear probability models and fixed-effects models are estimated to clarify the relationship between various forms of nonresident father involvement on maternal depression. The results suggest that in-kind support is most protective for maternal depression. However, father visitation, especially when done so infrequently, can raise maternal depression levels.",Dissertation,,,Health Behavior,English,eng,,,Essays on the Economics of Investment in Health,Ph.D.,University of Illinois,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1405110&site=ehost-live

We used a mathematical model of within-host virus evolution to study factors that could increase and decrease the probability of the remaining substitutions evolving after the virus has infected a mammalian host.

That is, it is endemic only in certain areas of the globe, with environmental and climatic characteristics that are ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes, which are the vector for transmitting the disease. This feature is the main reason why a large body of economic literature uses mortality from malaria as a proxy with which to measure the effect of geography on human outcomes. Cases of eradication are being scrutinized by scholars to determine the socioeconomic impacts of malaria. Among the various malaria parasites, the worst, Plasmodium falciparum, infested Italian regions for centuries until its eradication in the period 1945-50. This article presents an empirical assessment of the economic outcomes of the eradication of malaria in the Italian regions by exploiting the spatial variation in mortality rates. I found support for the hypothesis that the eradication of malaria increases human capital in the long run. In particular, I found that eradication increased the years of schooling by about 0.3 years, although my evidence suggests a greater effect on males than on females. Moreover, I found support for a long-run impact of eradication actions that operated through an intergenerational spillover effect and accounted for about 0.07 years of schooling.",Journal Article,,105-125,Health Behavior,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1372753&site=ehost-live

Given the uncertainties associated with vector-borne diseases, in terms of vector dynamics and disease transmission, it is critical to develop statistical models that address how and when such an infectious disease could spread throughout a region such as the USA. This paper considers a spatio-temporal statistical model for how an infectious disease could be carried into the USA by migratory waterfowl vectors during their seasonal migration and, ultimately, the risk of transmission of such a disease to domestic fowl. Modeling spatio-temporal data of this type is inherently difficult given the uncertainty associated with observations, complexity of the dynamics, high dimensionality of the underlying process, and the presence of excessive zeros. In particular, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the waterfowl migration are developed by way of a two-tiered functional temporal and spatial dimension reduction procedure that captures spatial and seasonal trends, as well as regional dynamics. Furthermore, the model relates the migration to a population of poultry farms that are known to be susceptible to such diseases, and is one of the possible avenues toward transmission to domestic poultry and humans. The result is a predictive distribution of those counties containing poultry farms that are at the greatest risk of having the infectious disease infiltrate their flocks assuming that the migratory population was infected. The model naturally fits into the hierarchical Bayesian framework.",Journal Article,,656-673,Related Disciplines,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1381421&site=ehost-live

This has been achieved through multiple reforms encouraging the prescription of generics at low prices versus patented drugs in the same class. Generic venlafaxine also presents an opportunity to save costs given the prevalence of depression. However, depression is more complex to treat, with physicians reluctant to change prescriptions if patients are responding to a particular antidepressant. Objectives--We assessed (a) changes in the utilization pattern of venlafaxine versus other newer antidepressants before and after the availability of generic venlafaxine and before and after the initiation of prescription restrictions for duloxetine limiting its prescription to refractory patients, (b) utilization of generic versus original venlafaxine after its availability, and (c) price reductions for generic venlafaxine and the subsequent influence on total expenditure on newer antidepressants over time. Methodology--We performed interrupted time series analysis of changes in monthly reimbursed prescriptions using defined daily doses (DDDs) of patients dispensed at least one newer antidepressant from January 2007 to August 2011. DDDs was defined as the average maintenance dose of a drug when used in its major indication in adults. This included 19 months after the availability of generic venlafaxine and before initiation of prescription restrictions for duloxetine to 13 months after prescription restrictions. Total expenditure and expenditure/DDD for venlafaxine were measured over time. Results--No appreciable change in the utilization pattern for venlafaxine was observed after generic availability when no appreciable demand-side activities by the regions (counties) were implemented to encourage its use. The utilization of venlafaxine significantly increased after prescription restrictions for duloxetine. Generic venlafaxine was dispensed once available, reaching 99.6% of total venlafaxine (DDD basis) by August 2011. There was an appreciable fall in expenditure for newer antidepressants in Sweden after generic venlafaxine despite increased utilization, helped by a 90% reduction in expenditure/DDD for venlafaxine by the end of the study versus prepatent loss prices. Conclusion--Multiple demand-side measures are needed to change physician prescribing habits. Authorities should not rely on a spillover effect between drug classes to effect change. Limited influence of prescription restrictions on the subsequent utilization of duloxetine reflects the complexity of this disease area.

The argument is put that a discourse of globally 'emerging' and 're-emerging' infection helped to shape a theory of financial contagion, which developed, particularly from 1997, in relation to financial crises in 'emerging markets' in Southeast Asia. Conversely, concerns about the economic impact of a global pandemic have been influential in shaping public health responses to communicable diseases from the early 1990s.

Methods--Adults (aged>/=18 years) and adolescents (aged 13-17 years) who had a parent, spouse, or child in their household with a chronic condition (Alzheimer's disease/dementia, arthritis, cancer, or depression) were recruited from a US national panel to participate in an on-line survey.

To date, analysis of the processes that prioritize, develop and deliver zoonoses control programmes in many low- and middle-income countries is lacking, despite its potential to highlight significant evidence gaps and institutional constraints to the intersectoral approach required for their control. Policy process analysis was conducted via a series of semi-structured interviews with key policy actors within various ministries and institutes in Uganda and Nigeria. The study concluded that despite the rhetoric around 'linear' models of health policy development promoting consultation with a wide range of national stakeholders, the decision-making process for zoonotic disease control appears instead overtly influenced by the external political economy of trending pandemic threats, often overlooking national and regional zoonoses priorities. The inclusion of political systems remains a key factor in the zoonoses analysis matrix, enhancing our understanding of the intersectoral and transdisciplinary approaches required for their control. The authors consider policy process analysis to be a fundamental first step of any attempt to holistically strengthen human and animal health systems in a development context, particularly regarding the promotion of integrated control policies for regionally important zoonoses under the growing One Health movement.",Journal Article,,804-812,National Government Expenditures and Health,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1609079&site=ehost-live

These challenges include air pollution, biodiversity loss, climate change, energy and food security, disease spread, species invasion, and water shortages and pollution. They are interconnected across three dimensions (organizational levels, space, and time) but are often separately studied and managed. Systems integration—holistic approaches to integrating various components of coupled human and natural systems (for example, socialecological systems and human-environment systems) across all dimensions—is necessary to address complex interconnections and identify effective solutions to sustainability challenges. ADVANCES: One major advance has been recognizing Earth as a large, coupled human and natural system consisting of many smaller coupled systems linked through flows of information, matter, and energy and evolving through time as a set of interconnected complex adaptive systems. A number of influential integrated frameworks (such as ecosystem services, environmental footprints, human-nature nexus, planetary boundaries, and telecoupling) and tools for systems integration have been developed and tested through interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary inquiries. Systems integration has led to fundamental discoveries and sustainability actions that are not possible by using conventional disciplinary, reductionist, and compartmentalized approaches. These include findings on emergent properties and complexity; interconnections among multiple key issues (such as air, climate, energy, food, land, and water); assessment of multiple, often conflicting, objectives; and synergistic interactions in which, for example, economic efficiency can be enhanced while environmental impacts are mitigated. In addition, systems integration allows for clarification and reassignment of environmental responsibilities (for example, among producers, consumers, and traders); mediation of trade-offs and enhancement of synergies; reduction of conflicts; and design of harmonious conservation and development policies and practices. OUTLOOK: Although some studies have recognized spillover effects (effects spilling over from interactions among other systems) or spatial externalities, there is a need to simultaneously consider socioeconomic and environmental effects rather than considering them separately. Furthermore, identifying causes, agents, and flows behind the spillover effects can help us to understand better and hence manage the effects across multiple systems and scales. Integrating spillover systems with sending and receiving systems through network analysis and other advanced analytical methods can uncover hidden interrelationships and lead to important insights. Human-nature feedbacks, including spatial feedbacks (such as those among sending, receiving, and spillover systems), are the core elements of coupled systems and thus are likely to play important roles in global sustainability. Systems integration for global sustainability is poised for more rapid development, and transformative changes aimed at connecting disciplinary silos are needed to sustain an increasingly telecoupled world.",Academic Journal,Article,,,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=slh&AN=101194333&site=ehost-live

Invasive species and pathogens pose significant threats to both the environment and society. Preventing and managing invaders is an interdisciplinary problem; it cannot be achieved solely through use of economic analysis nor just consideration of system biology or ecology. Human action and the environmental responses are interconnected and should be studied as such. Proper specification of models to address prevention and management require an understanding of species biology and system ecology, which are both influenced by human and environmental factors. This dissertation presents three essays on the economics of prevention and management of biological invasions with an emphasis on how space plays a role in introduction drivers and damage magnitudes. The questions addressed herein require consideration of biological, ecological, and economic processes to inform prevention and control policy. The first two essays explore the consequences of ignoring health risks resulting from land use change over time and space. The third essay addresses producer response to heterogeneous contamination risk in live animal input markets. The concept that a number of infectious diseases such as malaria, Ebola, and Zika virus are linked to changes in anthropogenic land use is becoming widely known and accepted. However, infectious disease is rarely considered as a cost in land use decision-making. Chapter 1 develops a model that includes the health consequences of land conversion decisions. A dynamic harvest model is used to determine an optimal rate and area of land conversion that accounts for the benefits and consequences of environmental conversion, including increased prevalence of malaria. Simulations indicate the cost of ignoring the change in malaria prevalence as a consequence of land use change can create significant welfare losses and that this ignored cost of conversion should be factored into policy making. The second chapter builds on the results of Chapter 1; health consequences arising from land use change are great enough to alter the net benefits of land conversion. Chapter 2 addresses whether risk of infectious disease modifies the optimal patterns and timing of land 1 conversion. The dynamic model developed in this chapter allows for different time paths and areas of conversion across land units or regions, where any differences in conversion patterns are driven by spatial orientation of the land units. When the costs of infectious disease are correlated with patterns of land conversion, the optimal sites of land conversion are altered. Location of conversion can be used as a first step in mitigating health risks of altered landscapes and the patterns are dependent on magnitude of the disease costs. The results of this chapter are consistent with recommendations of ecologists and epidemiologists to strategically select conversion patterns by considering the ecological impacts of land use decisions. Chapter 3 models producer response to information about contamination risk in live animal import markets. Trade and movement of live animals and animal products drive the introduction and spread of a number of zoonotic and livestock diseases. Existing trade policies are geared toward minimizing the risk of introducing a pest or pathogen by banning imports from specific sources. Understanding how agents behave in a decentralized environment can give insight into how to create targeted policies for minimizing risk. The model examines the trade-offs faced by importers when choosing where to source live and risky inputs to production. Simulations using data from the live cattle trade industry give insight into how and when importers substitute away from high-risk sources. The magnitude of substitution varies by the amount of information the importer uses in its risk estimation. The value to risk trade-off can be measured as an elasticity, detailing how individual producers respond to risk. Simulations indicate providing producers with more detailed information sets to determine the expected damages of import decisions reduces system costs and improves welfare over strict bans on trade.",Dissertation,,,Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations,English,eng,,,Spatial Considerations in the Economics of Prevention and Control of Biological Invasions,Ph.D.,University of Wyoming,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1678429&site=ehost-live

DAMIP is a multiple-group, concurrent classifier that offers unique features not present in other models: a nonlinear data transformation to manage the curse of dimensionality and noise; a reserved-judgment region that handles fuzzy entities; and constraints on the allowed percentage of misclassifications. Using DAMIP, implemented results for yellow fever demonstrated that, for the first time, a vaccine's ability to immunize a patient could be successfully predicted (with accuracy of greater than 90 percent) within one week after vaccination.

Nevertheless, communicable diseases remain an important public health issue in the region. In December 2009, within the framework of its Regional Programming for Asia (2007-2013), the European Union (EU) launched a Regional Program on Highly Pathogenic and Emerging Diseases (HPED) in Asia. This 4-year interregional cooperation initiative aimed at enable ASEAN to control zoonoses and to improve pandemic preparedness in the region. Assessing this interregional initiative, the main objective of this paper is to shed light on the nature and functions of health interregionalism between Asia and Europe and its influence on regional health governance. It concludes that while in the specific context of the EU-ASEAN HPED program, health interregionalism had varied functions and a substantial influence on regional health governance, this initiative did not use the full potential that interregional health mechanism may provide to influence the development of another region or to promote the EU's specific actorness in regional and global health.",Journal Article,,243-259,Health Behavior,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1663541&site=ehost-live

Indeed, a $1 increase in per capita public health spending reduces the gonorrhea (syphilis) rate by approximately 0.30 (0.60) percent. Spillover effects are also associated with public health spending, as increases in border-county spending reduce STD rates. To varying degrees of significance, county STD rates are also sensitive to lagged STD rates, county racial composition, whether or not a public university is located within the county, and a yearly time trend.",Journal Article,,149-159,State and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1647498&site=ehost-live

Using the exact timing of vaccination relative to birth, we estimate the effects of local pertussis outbreaks occurring in-utero and during the first two months of life on the likelihood of on-time initial immunization for pertussis and other immunizations. We find that parents respond to changes in perceived disease risk: pertussis outbreaks within a state increase the rate of on-time receipt of the pertussis vaccine at two months of age. This response is concentrated among low-socioeconomic status (SES) subgroups. In addition, we find that pertussis outbreaks increase the likelihood of immunization against other vaccine-preventable diseases. These spillover effects are almost as large the direct effects and are present only for vaccines that are typically given during the same visit as the pertussis vaccine, which suggests that healthcare access costs play an important role in parents' vaccination decisions.",Working Paper,,,"Health, Education, and Welfare: General",English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1668110&site=ehost-live

This paper estimates the effects of the establishment of a pre-antibiotic era public health institution, known as a TB dispensary, designed to prevent the spread of the disease. Our annual difference-in-differences estimation reveals that the rollout of the dispensaries across Danish cities led to a 19 percent decline in the TB mortality rate, but exhibits no significant impacts on other diseases in placebo regressions. We next take advantage of the dispensaries' explicit targeting on TB to set up a triple-differences model which exploits other diseases as controls and obtain a similar magnitude of the effect. Using monthly mortality data in a similar strategy leads to the same conclusion. In addition, we find small positive spillover effects of the dispensaries on productivity as measured by annual income per taxpayer at the city level, digitized from historical tax-assessment records. Overall, the evidence highlights the provision of personalized information on infectious diseases as a cost-effective cause of the historical mortality decline.",Working Paper,,114 pages,Externalities,English,eng,,,,,,,,http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1667864&site=ehost-live

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Objectif: Évaluer la santé psychologique immédiate et prolongée des travailleurs de la santé qui étaient à haut risque d'exposition durant l'épidémie du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS). Méthodes : Au plus fort de l'épidémie du SRAS en 2003, nous avons évalué les travailleurs de la santé de 2 hôpitaux généraux de soins actifs de Hong Kong, à l'aide de l'échelle de stress perçu en 10 items (PSS-10). Un an plus tard, nous avons réévalué ces travailleurs avec la PSS-10, l'échelle de dépression et d'anxiété en 21 items (DASS-21) et l'échelle des répercussions d'événements révisée (IES-R). Nous avons recruté des travailleurs de la santé à risque élevé qui pratiquaient la médecine respiratoire et nous les avons comparés avec des travailleurs de la médecine non respiratoire, qui formaient le groupe témoin de travailleurs de la sante a faible risque. Résultats : En 2003, les travailleurs de la santé à risque élevé avaient des niveaux de stress élevés (score à la PSS-10 = 17,0), lesquels ne différaient pas significativement des niveaux du groupe témoin de travailleurs de la sante a faible risque (score a la PSS-10 = 15,9). Un plus grand nombre de travailleurs de la santé à risque élevé déclaraient de la fatigue, un mauvais sommeil, des inquietudes pour leur sante, et la crainte des contacts sociaux, malgré leur confiance dans les mesures de contrôle de l'infection. En 2004, cependant, les niveaux de stress du groupe à risque élevé étaient non seulement plus hauts (score à la PSS-10 = 18,6) mais aussi significativement plus élevés que les scores du groupe témoin de travailleurs de la santé à faible risque (score a la PSS-10 = 14,8, P<0,05). En 2004, les niveaux de stress percu du groupe a risque élevé étaient associés avec des scores de stress plus élevés de dépression, d'anxiété et post-traumatique (P<0,00 1). Les scores de stress post-traumatique étaient un médiateur partiel de la relation entre le risque élevé d'exposition au SRAS et un stress percu élevé. Conclusions : Les travailleurs de la santé qui étaient à risque élevé de contracter le SRAS semblent avoir non seulement un stress chronique mais aussi des niveaux élevés de dépression et d'anxiété. Les employés de premiere ligne pourraient bénéficier de gestion du stress dans le cadre de la préparation à d'autres épidémies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Il utilise des concepts provenant de la littÃ©rature sur le VIH/SIDA et sur l'agriculture: notamment les concepts de prÃ©disposition (susceptibility) et de rÃ©sistance (Ã  l'infection), de vulnÃ©rabilitÃ©et de resilience (aux effets socio-Ã©conomiques du SIDA).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
