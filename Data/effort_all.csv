1,Cecilia,NO,NA,"B. Joseph Hinnebusch, Clayton O. Jarrett, David M. Bland",“fleaing” the plague: adaptations of yersinia pestis to its insect vector that lead to transmission,2017,Annual Review of Microbiology,Annual Reviews,"Interest in arthropod-borne pathogens focuses primarily on how they cause disease in humans. How they produce a transmissible infection in their arthropod host is just as critical to their life cycle, however. Yersinia pestis adopts a unique life stage in the digestive tract of its flea vector, characterized by rapid formation of a bacterial biofilm that is enveloped in a complex extracellular polymeric substance. Localization and adherence of the biofilm to the flea foregut is essential for transmission. Here, we review the molecular and genetic mechanisms of these processes and present a comparative evaluation and updated model of two related transmission mechanisms."
2,Cecilia,NO,NA,Nickolas J. Panopoulos,a career on both sides of the atlantic: memoirs of a molecular plant pathologist,2017,Annual Review of Phytopathology,Annual Reviews,"This article recounts the experiences that shaped my career as a molecular plant pathologist. It focuses primarily on technical and conceptual developments in molecular phytobacteriology, shares some personal highlights and untold stories that impacted my professional development, and describes the early years of agricultural biotechnology. Writing this article required reflection on events occurring over several decades that were punctuated by a mid-career relocation across the Atlantic. I hope it will still be useful, informative, and enjoyable to read. An extended version of the abstract is provided in the Supplemental Materials, available online."

Ebel ",a global perspective on the epidemiology of west nile virus,2008,Annual Review of Entomology,Annual Reviews,"West Nile virus (WNV) (Flavivirus: Flaviviridae) is the most widespread arbovirus in the world. A significant range expansion occurred beginning in 1999 when the virus was introduced into New York City. This review highlights recent research into WNV epizootiology and epidemiology, including recent advances in understanding of the host-virus interaction at the molecular, organismal, and ecological levels. Vector control strategies, vaccines, and antivirals, which now must be considered on a global scale, are also discussed."
4,Joy,NO,NA,"Elizabeth T. Borer, Anna-Liisa Laine, Eric W. Seabloom",a multiscale approach to plant disease using the metacommunity concept,2016,Annual Review of Phytopathology,Annual Reviews,"Plant disease arises from the interaction of processes occurring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. With new tools such as next-generation sequencing, we are learning about the diversity of microbes circulating within and among plant populations and often coinhabiting host individuals. The proliferation of pathogenic microbes depends on single-species dynamics and multispecies interactions occurring within and among host cells, the spatial organization and genetic landscape of hosts, the frequency and mode of transmission among hosts and host populations, and the abiotic environmental context. Here, we examine empirical evidence from these multiple scales to assess the utility of metacommunity theory, a theoretical framework developed for free-living organisms to further our understanding of and assist in predicting plant-pathogen infection and spread. We suggest that deeper understanding of disease dynamics can arise through the application of this conceptual framework at scales ranging from individual cells to landscapes. In addition, we use this multiscale theoretical perspective to synthesize existing knowledge, generate novel hypotheses, and point toward promising future opportunities for the study of plant pathogens in natural populations."
5,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Nicholas Freudenberg, Daliah Heller",a review of opportunities to improve the health of people involved in the criminal justice system in the united states,2016,Annual Review of Public Health,Annual Reviews,"In the past decade, many constituencies have questioned the efficacy, cost, and unintended consequences of mass incarceration in the United States. Although substantial evidence now demonstrates that US incarceration policies have had unintended adverse health consequences, we know less about the strategies and policies that can prevent or reduce these problems for justice-involved individuals and how the criminal justice system (CJS) can contribute to the Healthy People 2020 national goal of eliminating inequities in health. This review examines strategies that have been used to improve the health of people at various stages of CJS involvement, including diversion from jail and prison stays into community settings, improvements to the social and physical environments within correctional facilities, provision of health and other services to inmates, assistance for people leaving correctional facilities to make the transition back to the community, and systems coordination and integration."
6,Joy,NO,NA,"Joshua B. Benoit, Geoffrey M. Attardo, Aaron A. Baumann, Veronika Michalkova, Serap Aksoy",adenotrophic viviparity in tsetse flies: potential for population control and as an insect model for lactation,2015,Annual Review of Entomology,Annual Reviews,"Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), vectors of African trypanosomes, are distinguished by their specialized reproductive biology, defined by adenotrophic viviparity (maternal nourishment of progeny by glandular secretions followed by live birth). This trait has evolved infrequently among insects and requires unique reproductive mechanisms. A key event in Glossina reproduction involves the transition between periods of lactation and nonlactation (dry periods). Increased lipolysis, nutrient transfer to the milk gland, and milk-specific protein production characterize lactation, which terminates at the birth of the progeny and is followed by a period of involution. The dry stage coincides with embryogenesis of the progeny, during which lipid reserves accumulate in preparation for the next round of lactation. The obligate bacterial symbiont Wigglesworthia glossinidia is critical to tsetse reproduction and likely provides B vitamins required for metabolic processes underlying lactation and/or progeny development. Here we describe findings that utilized transcriptomics, physiological assays, and RNA interference–based functional analysis to understand different components of adenotrophic viviparity in tsetse flies."
7,Joy,NO,NA,"Simon Carpenter, Philip S. Mellor, Assane G. Fall, Claire Garros, Gert J. Venter",african horse sickness virus: history transmission and current status,2017,Annual Review of Entomology,Annual Reviews,"African horse sickness virus (AHSV) is a lethal arbovirus of equids that is transmitted between hosts primarily by biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). AHSV affects draft, thoroughbred, and companion horses and donkeys in Africa, Asia, and Europe. In this review, we examine the impact of AHSV critically and discuss entomological studies that have been conducted to improve understanding of its epidemiology and control. The transmission of AHSV remains a major research focus and we critically review studies that have implicated both Culicoides and other blood-feeding arthropods in this process. We explore AHSV both as an epidemic pathogen and within its endemic range as a barrier to development, an area of interest that has been underrepresented in studies of the virus to date. By discussing AHSV transmission in the African republics of South Africa and Senegal, we provide a more balanced view of the virus as a threat to equids in a diverse range of settings, thus leading to a discussion of key areas in which our knowledge of transmission could be improved. The use of entomological data to detect, predict and control AHSV is also examined, including reference to existing studies carried out during unprecedented outbreaks of bluetongue virus in Europe, an arbovirus of wild and domestic ruminants also transmitted by Culicoides."
8,Joy,NO,NA,"Scott de Marchi, Scott E. Page",agent-based models,2014,Annual Review of Political Science,Annual Reviews,"Agent-based models (ABMs) provide a methodology to explore systems of interacting, adaptive, diverse, spatially situated actors. Outcomes in ABMs can be equilibrium points, equilibrium distributions, cycles, randomness, or complex patterns; these outcomes are not directly determined by assumptions but instead emerge from the interactions of actors in the model. These behaviors may range from rational and payoff-maximizing strategies to rules that mimic heuristics identified by cognitive science. Agent-based techniques can be applied in isolation to create high-fidelity models and to explore new questions using simple constructions. They can also be used as a complement to deductive techniques. Overall, ABMs offer the potential to advance social sciences and to help us better understand our complex world."
9,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Carl E. Pray, Keith O. Fuglie",agricultural research by the private sector,2015,Annual Review of Resource Economics,Annual Reviews,"The private sector has assumed a larger role in developing improved technology for food and agriculture, with private agricultural R&D spending growing faster than public agricultural R&D spending over the past several decades. Major drivers have been new commercial opportunities afforded by scientific advances and liberalization of agricultural input markets. Along with rising private R&D investment, agricultural input industries have undergone significant structural changes. These developments have been pronounced in both high-income and developing countries. The rising importance of private R&D, however, does not imply a diminished role of the public sector, as most empirical evidence points to complementarities between public and private agricultural R&D."
10,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Derek Byerlee, Alain de Janvry, Elisabeth Sadoulet",agriculture for development: toward a new paradigm,2009,Annual Review of Resource Economics,Annual Reviews,"The fundamental role that agriculture plays in development has long been recognized. In the seminal work on the subject, agriculture was seen as a source of contributions that helped induce industrial growth and a structural transformation of the economy. However, globalization, integrated value chains, rapid technological and institutional innovations, and environmental constraints have deeply changed the context for agriculture's role. We argue that a new paradigm is needed that recognizes agriculture's multiple functions for development in that emerging context: triggering economic growth, reducing poverty, narrowing income disparities, providing food security, and delivering environmental services. Yet, governments and donors have neglected these functions of agriculture with the result that agriculture growth has been reduced, 75% of world poverty is rural, sectoral income disparities have exploded, food insecurity has returned, and environmental degradation is widespread, compromising sustainability. Mobilizing these functions requires shifting the political economy to overcome antiagriculture policy biases, strengthening governance for agriculture, and tailoring priorities to country conditions."
11,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Stefan Dercon, Douglas Gollin",agriculture in african development: theories and strategies,2014,Annual Review of Resource Economics,Annual Reviews,"Agriculture is the largest sector in most sub-Saharan economies in terms of employment, and it plays an important role in supplying food and export earnings. Rural poverty rates remain high, and labor productivity is strikingly low. This article asks how these factors shape the role of agriculture in African development strategies. Is agricultural growth a prerequisite for growth in other sectors? Or will urbanization and nonagricultural export markets ultimately be the forces that pull the rural economy into higher productivity? We argue that agricultural development strategies will vary widely because of heterogeneity across and within countries."
12,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Thomas W. Valente, Stephanie R. Pitts",an appraisal of social network theory and analysis as applied to public health: challenges and opportunities,2017,Annual Review of Public Health,Annual Reviews,"The use of social network theory and analysis methods as applied to public health has expanded greatly in the past decade, yielding a significant academic literature that spans almost every conceivable health issue. This review identifies several important theoretical challenges that confront the field but also provides opportunities for new research. These challenges include (a) measuring network influences, (b) identifying appropriate influence mechanisms, (c) the impact of social media and computerized communications, (d) the role of networks in evaluating public health interventions, and (e) ethics. Next steps for the field are outlined and the need for funding is emphasized. Recently developed network analysis techniques, technological innovations in communication, and changes in theoretical perspectives to include a focus on social and environmental behavioral influences have created opportunities for new theory and ever broader application of social networks to public health topics."
13,Cecilia,NO,NA,Michael D. Lairmore,animal models of bovine leukemia virus and human t-lymphotrophic virus type-1: insights in transmission and pathogenesis,2014,Annual Review of Animal Biosciences,Annual Reviews,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and human T-lymphotrophic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) are related retroviruses associated with persistent and lifelong infections and a low incidence of lymphomas within their hosts. Both viruses can be spread through contact with bodily fluids containing infected cells, most often from mother to offspring through breast milk. Each of these complex retroviruses contains typical gag, pol, and env genes but also unique, nonstructural proteins encoded from the pX region. These nonstructural genes encode the Tax and Rex regulatory proteins, as well as novel proteins essential for viral spread in vivo. Improvements in the molecular tools to test these viral determinants in cellular and animal models have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of each virus. Comparisons of BLV and HTLV-1 provide insights into mechanisms of spread and tumor formation, as well as potential approaches to therapeutic intervention against the infections."

Mychajliw, Samuel T.",anthropogenic extinction dominates holocene declines of west indian mammals,2017,"Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics",Annual Reviews,"The extensive postglacial mammal losses in the West Indies provide an opportunity to evaluate extinction dynamics, but limited data have hindered our ability to test hypotheses. Here, we analyze the tempo and dynamics of extinction using a novel data set of faunal last-appearance dates and human first-appearance dates, demonstrating widespread overlap between humans and now-extinct native mammals. Humans arrived in four waves (Lithic, Archaic, Ceramic, and European), each associated with increased environmental impact. Large-bodied mammals and several bats were extinct by the Archaic, following protracted extinction dynamics perhaps reflecting habitat loss. Most small-bodied rodents and lipotyphlan insectivores survived the Ceramic, but extensive landscape transformation and the introduction of invasive mammals following European colonization caused further extinctions, leaving a threatened remnant fauna. Both large- and small-bodied nonvolant mammals disappeared, reflecting complex relationships between body size, ecology, and anthropogenic change. Extinct bats were generally larger species, paralleling declines from natural catastrophes."
15,Joy,NO,NA,"Markus Herrmann, Ramanan Laxminarayan",antibiotic effectiveness: new challenges in natural resource management,2010,Annual Review of Resource Economics,Annual Reviews,"Problems of optimal natural resource extraction that were first addressed by economists in the contexts of fisheries and forests have reemerged in the context of a newly recognized resource: antibiotic effectiveness. This review introduces economists to the growing literature on optimal use, innovation, and regulation of antibiotic effectiveness. Along the way, we draw links and parallels to similar problems in the management of other resources with which economists may be more familiar, and we address new questions that have arisen in the context of antibiotic effectiveness but that are also relevant to other resources."
16,Joy,NO,NA,"Vidadi Yusibov, Natasha Kushnir, Stephen J. Streatfield",antibody production in plants and green algae,2016,Annual Review of Plant Biology ,Annual Reviews,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have a wide range of modern applications, including research, diagnostic, therapeutic, and industrial uses. Market demand for mAbs is high and continues to grow. Although mammalian systems, which currently dominate the biomanufacturing industry, produce effective and safe recombinant mAbs, they have a limited manufacturing capacity and high costs. Bacteria, yeast, and insect cell systems are highly scalable and cost effective but vary in their ability to produce appropriate posttranslationally modified mAbs. Plants and green algae are emerging as promising production platforms because of their time and cost efficiencies, scalability, lack of mammalian pathogens, and eukaryotic posttranslational protein modification machinery. So far, plant- and algae-derived mAbs have been produced predominantly as candidate therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancer. These candidates have been extensively evaluated in animal models, and some have shown efficacy in clinical trials. Here, we review ongoing efforts to advance the production of mAbs in plants and algae."
17,Joy,NO,NA,"J.E. Butler, Nancy Wertz, Marek Sinkora",antibody repertoire development in swine,2017,Annual Review of Animal Biosciences,Annual Reviews,"We describe the domestication of the species, explore its value to agriculture and bioscience, and compare its immunoglobulin (Ig) genes to those of other vertebrates. For encyclopedic information, we cite earlier reviews and chapters. We provide current gene maps for the heavy and light chain loci and describe their polygeny and polymorphy. B-cell and antibody repertoire development is a major focus, and we present findings that challenge several mouse-centric paradigms. We focus special attention on the role of ileal Peyer's patches, the largest secondary lymphoid tissues in newborn piglets and a feature of all artiodactyls. We believe swine fetal development and early class switch evolved to provide natural secretory IgA antibodies able to prevent translocation of bacteria from the gut while the bacterial PAMPs drive development of adaptive immunity. We discuss the value of using the isolator piglet model to address these issues."
18,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Samantha L. Lammie, James M. Hughes",antimicrobial resistance food safety and one health: the need for convergence,2016,Annual Review of Food Science and Technology,Annual Reviews,"Antimicrobial resistance is a complex, multifaceted, urgent global health problem. There is increasing concern about the emergence of multidrug-resistant superbugs. These superbugs result in infections responsive to treatment with few if any currently available antimicrobial agents, reviving memories of the preantibiotic era and evoking concerns about a postantibiotic era. Use of antibiotics exerts selective pressure on pathogens as well as on commensal organisms that are part of the normal flora of humans, animals, and the environment; this favors the emergence of resistant strains and sometimes involves the food supply. Addressing this urgent threat requires implementation of a multifaceted strategy that has been articulated in the past few years; implementation will require sustained political will, investment in systems and research, and a One Health approach involving improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration among the many professional disciplines and organizations with important roles to play at the intersection of human, animal, and environmental health. Priorities include strengthened human and animal health surveillance and monitoring for resistant organisms, antimicrobial stewardship programs, infection-control programs, development and approval of new antimicrobial agents, research on innovative therapeutic approaches, development of rapid diagnostic tests and new vaccines, and educational programs that target professional groups and the public."
19,Joy,NO,NA,"David Horn, Manoj T. Duraisingh",antiparasitic chemotherapy: from genomes to mechanisms,2014,Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology,Annual Reviews,"Owing to the absence of antiparasitic vaccines and the constant threat of drug resistance, the development of novel antiparasitic chemotherapies remains of major importance for disease control. A better understanding of drug transport (uptake and efflux), drug metabolism and the identification of drug targets, and mechanisms of drug resistance would facilitate the development of more effective therapies. Here, we focus on malaria and African trypanosomiasis. We review existing drugs and drug development, emphasizing high-throughput genomic and genetic approaches, which hold great promise for elucidating antiparasitic mechanisms. We describe the approaches and technologies that have been influential for each parasite and develop new ideas for future research directions, including mode-of-action studies for drug target deconvolution."
20,Joy,NO,NA,"Robert D. Holt, Michael B. Bonsall",apparent competition,2017,"Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics",Annual Reviews,"Most species have one or more natural enemies, e.g., predators, parasites, pathogens, and herbivores, among others. These species in turn typically attack multiple victim species. This leads to the possibility of indirect interactions among those victims, both positive and negative. The term apparent competition commonly denotes negative indirect interactions between victim species that arise because they share a natural enemy. This indirect interaction, which in principle can be reflected in many facets of the distribution and abundance of individual species and more broadly govern the structure of ecological communities in time and space, pervades many natural ecosystems. It also is a central theme in many applied ecological problems, including the control of agricultural pests, harvesting, the conservation of endangered species, and the dynamics of emerging diseases. At one end of the scale of life, apparent competition characterizes intriguing aspects of dynamics within individual organisms—for example, the immune system is akin in many ways to a predator that can induce negative indirect interactions among different pathogens. At intermediate scales of biological organization, the existence and strength of apparent competition depend upon many contingent details of individual behavior and life history, as well as the community and spatial context within which indirect interactions play out. At the broadest scale of macroecology and macroevolution, apparent competition may play a major, if poorly understood, role in the evolution of species’ geographical ranges and adaptive radiations."
21,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Charles Weissmann , Adriano Aguzzi ",approaches to therapy of prion diseases,2005,Annual Review of Medicine,Annual Reviews,"Devising approaches to the therapy of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, is beset by many difficulties. For one, the nature of the infectious agent, the prion, is understood only in outline, and its composition, structure, and mode of replication are still shrouded in mystery. In addition, the mechanism of pathogenesis is not well understood. Because clinical disease affects mainly the brain parenchyme, therapeutic agents must be able to traverse the brain-blood barrier (BBB) or have to be introduced directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue. And finally, because the disease is usually recognized only after onset of severe clinical symptoms, the question arises as to whether the neurodegenerative processes can be reversed to any extent after a successful eradication of the agent."
22,Cecilia,YES,NO,Sharon N. DeWitte,archaeological evidence of epidemics can inform future epidemics,2016,Annual Review of Anthropology,Annual Reviews,"The recent Ebola epidemic provides a dramatic example of the devastation and fear generated by epidemics, particularly those caused by new emerging or reemerging diseases. A focus on the control and prevention of diseases in living populations dominates most epidemic disease research. However, research on epidemics in the past provides a temporal depth to our understanding of the context and consequences of diseases and is crucial for predicting how diseases might shape human biology and demography in the future. This article reviews recent research on historic epidemics of plague and tuberculosis, both of which have affected human populations for millennia. Research on these diseases demonstrates the range (and differential availability) of various lines of evidence (e.g., burial context, diagnostic skeletal lesions, molecular data) that inform about past disease in general. I highlight how research on past epidemics may be informative in ways that benefit living populations."
23,Joy,NO,NA,Philippe Brouqui,arthropod-borne diseases associated with political and social disorder,2011,Annual Review of Entomology,Annual Reviews,"The living conditions and the crowded situations of the homeless, war refugees, or victims of a natural disaster provide ideal conditions for the spread of lice, fleas, ticks, flies and mites. The consequence of arthropod infestation in these situations is underestimated. Along with louse-borne infections such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever, the relationship between Acinetobacter spp.–infected lice and bacteremia in the homeless is not clear. Murine typhus, tungiasis, and myiasis are likely underestimated, and there has been a reemergence of bed bugs. Attempted eradication of the body louse, despite specific measures, has been disappointing, and infections with Bartonella quintana continue to be reported. The efficacy of ivermectin in eradicating the human body louse, although the effect is not sustained, might provide new therapeutic approaches. Arthropod-borne diseases continue to emerge within the deprived population. Public health programs should be engaged rapidly to control these pests and reduce the incidence of these transmissible diseases."
24,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Peter H. Adler, Holly C. Tuten, Mark P. Nelder",arthropods of medicoveterinary importance in zoos,2011,Annual Review of Entomology,Annual Reviews,"Zoos present a unique assemblage of arthropods, captive vertebrates, free-roaming wildlife, humans, and plants, each with its own biota of symbiotic organisms. Arthropods of medicoveterinary importance are well represented in zoos, and an ample literature documents their influence in these animal-rich environments. Mosquitoes are of greatest significance because of the animal and human pathogens they transmit, followed by ectoparasites, many of which are exotic and present health risks to captive and native animals. Biting flies, cockroaches, filth flies, and triatomid bugs represent additional concerns. Integrated management programs for arthropods in zoos are commonplace. Zoos can play a role in biosurveillance, serving as an advanced guard for detecting exotic arthropods and vector-borne diseases. We provide the first review of arthropods of medicoveterinary importance in zoos. A case is made for the value of collaborations between entomologists and zoo personnel as a means of enhancing research and public education while safeguarding the health of captive animals and the public."
25,Joy,NO,NA,"Valerie Cortez, Victoria A. Meliopoulos, Erik A. Karlsson, Virginia Hargest, Cydney Johnson, Stacey Schultz-Cherry",astrovirus biology and pathogenesis,2017,Annual Review of Virology,Annual Reviews,"Astroviruses are nonenveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause gastrointestinal illness. Although a leading cause of pediatric diarrhea, human astroviruses are among the least characterized enteric RNA viruses. However, by using in vitro methods and animal models to characterize virus-host interactions, researchers have discovered several important properties of astroviruses, including the ability of the astrovirus capsid to act as an enterotoxin, disrupting the gut epithelial barrier. Improved animal models are needed to study this phenomenon, along with the pathogenesis of astroviruses, particularly in those strains that can cause extraintestinal disease. Much like for other enteric viruses, the current dogma states that astroviruses infect in a species-specific manner; however, this assumption is being challenged by growing evidence that these viruses have potential to cross species barriers. This review summarizes these remarkable facets of astrovirus biology, highlighting critical steps toward increasing our understanding of this unique enteric pathogen."
26,Cecilia,NO,NA,David B. Lewis ,avian flu to human influenza,2006,Annual Review of Medicine,Annual Reviews,"Influenza A viral infection causes substantial annual morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly for infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. The virus mainly replicates in the respiratory tract and is spread by respiratory secretions. A growing concern is the recent identification of H5N1 strains of avian influenza A in Asia that were previously thought to infect only wild birds and poultry, but have now infected humans, cats, pigs, and other mammals, often with fatal results, in an ongoing outbreak. A human pandemic with H5N1 virus could potentially be catastrophic because most human populations have negligible antibody-mediated immunity to the H5 surface protein and this viral subtype is highly virulent. Whether an H5N1 influenza pandemic will occur is likely to hinge on whether the viral strains involved in the current outbreak acquire additional mutations that facilitate efficient human-to-human transfer of infection. Although there is no historical precedent for an H5N1 avian strain causing widespread human-to-human transmission, some type of influenza A pandemic is very likely in the near future. The possibility of an H5N1 influenza pandemic has highlighted the many current limitations of treatment with antiviral agents and of vaccine production and immunogenicity. Future vaccine strategies that may include more robust induction of T-cell responses, such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, may provide better protection than is offered by current vaccines, which rely solely or mainly on antibody neutralization of infection."

Gilbert, Eugene Myers, Bat1K Consortium",bat biology genomes and the bat1k project: to generate chromosome-level genomes for all living bat species,2018,Annual Review of Animal Biosciences,Annual Reviews,"Bats are unique among mammals, possessing some of the rarest mammalian adaptations, including true self-powered flight, laryngeal echolocation, exceptional longevity, unique immunity, contracted genomes, and vocal learning. They provide key ecosystem services, pollinating tropical plants, dispersing seeds, and controlling insect pest populations, thus driving healthy ecosystems. They account for more than 20% of all living mammalian diversity, and their crown-group evolutionary history dates back to the Eocene. Despite their great numbers and diversity, many species are threatened and endangered. Here we announce Bat1K, an initiative to sequence the genomes of all living bat species (n?1,300) to chromosome-level assembly. The Bat1K genome consortium unites bat biologists (>132 members as of writing), computational scientists, conservation organizations, genome technologists, and any interested individuals committed to a better understanding of the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the unique adaptations of bats. Our aim is to catalog the unique genetic diversity present in all living bats to better understand the molecular basis of their unique adaptations; uncover their evolutionary history; link genotype with phenotype; and ultimately better understand, promote, and conserve bats. Here we review the unique adaptations of bats and highlight how chromosome-level genome assemblies can uncover the molecular basis of these traits. We present a novel sequencing and assembly strategy and review the striking societal and scientific benefits that will result from the Bat1K initiative."

Hayman,bats as viral reservoirs,2016,Annual Review of Virology,Annual Reviews,"Bats are hosts of a range of viruses, including ebolaviruses, and many important human viral infections, such as measles and mumps, may have their ancestry traced back to bats. Here, I review viruses of all viral families detected in global bat populations. The viral diversity in bats is substantial, and viruses with all known types of genomic structures and replication strategies have been discovered in bats. However, the discovery of viruses is not geographically even, with some apparently undersampled regions, such as South America. Furthermore, some bat families, including those with global or wide distributions such as Emballonuridae and Miniopteridae, are underrepresented on viral databases. Future studies, including those that address these sampling gaps along with those that develop our understanding of viral-host relationships, are highlighted."

Pattanayak, Alexander Pfaff",behavior environment and health in developing countries: evaluation and valuation,2009,Annual Review of Resource Economics,Annual Reviews,"We consider health and environmental quality in developing countries, where limited resources constrain behaviors that combat enormously burdensome health challenges. We focus on four huge challenges that are preventable (i.e., are resolved in rich countries). We distinguish them as special cases in a general model of household behavior, which is critical and depends on risk information. Simply informing households may achieve a lot in the simplest challenge (groundwater arsenic); yet, for the three infectious situations discussed (respiratory, diarrhea, and malaria), community coordination and public provision may also be necessary. More generally, social interactions may justify additional policies. For each situation, we discuss the valuation of private spillovers (i.e., externalities) and evaluation of public policies to reduce environmental risks and spillovers. Finally, we reflect on open questions in our model and knowledge gaps in the empirical literature including the challenges of scaling up and climate change."

This article reviews a few of the principal ways in which health depends on biodiversity, including the discovery of new medicines, biomedical research, the provision of food, and the distribution and spread of infections. It also examines how changes in biological diversity underlie much of the global burden of disease and how a more thorough understanding of life on earth and its relationships has the potential to greatly alleviate and prevent human suffering."

The coevolution of sand flies with Leishmania species of mammals and lizards is considered in relation to the landscape epidemiology of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease. Evolutionary hypotheses are unresolved, so a practical phlebotomine classification is proposed to aid biomedical information retrieval. The vectors of Leishmania are tabulated and new criteria for their incrimination are given. Research on fly-parasite-host interactions, fly saliva, and behavioral ecology is reviewed in relation to parasite manipulation of blood feeding, vaccine targets, and pheromones for lures. Much basic research is based on few transmission cycles, so generalizations should be made with caution. Integrated research and control programs have begun, but improved control of leishmaniasis and nuisance-biting requires greater emphasis on population genetics and transmission modeling. Most leishmaniasis transmission is zoonotic, affecting the poor and tourists in rural and natural areas, and therefore control should be compatible with environmental conservation."

This paradigm shift in modern medicine of using cells as novel therapeutics can be realized only if suitable manufacturing technologies for large-scale, cost-effective, reproducible production of high-quality cells can be developed. Here we review the state of the art in therapeutic cell manufacturing, including cell purification and isolation, activation and differentiation, genetic modification, expansion, packaging, and preservation.

In this article, we introduce and review three emerging zoonotic viruses. Novel hantaviruses emerged in the Americas in the mid-1990s as the cause of severe respiratory infections, designated hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, with case fatality rates of around 40%. Nipah virus emerged a few years later, causing respiratory infections and encephalitis in Southeast Asia, with case fatality rates ranging from 40% to more than 90%. A new coronavirus emerged in 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula with a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory infections, later designated as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and an initial case fatality rate of more than 40%.

An intriguing aspect of Brucella infection is the ability of these bacteria to evade the host immune response, leading to pathogen persistence. Conversely, in the reproductive tract of infected animals, this stealthy pathogen is able to cause an acute severe inflammatory response. In this review, we discuss the different mechanisms used by Brucella to cause disease, with emphasis on its virulence factors and the dichotomy between chronic persistence and reproductive disease."

The RNA binding protein host factor I (HF-I) encoded by the hfq gene is required for the efficient translation of the stationary-phase ? factor RpoS in many bacteria, and a Brucella abortus hfq mutant displays a phenotype in vitro, which suggests that it has a generalized defect in stationary-phase physiology. The inability of the B. abortus hfq mutant to survive and replicate in a wild-type manner in cultured murine macrophages, and the profound attenuation displayed by this strain and its B. melitensis counterpart in experimentally infected animals indicate that stationary-phase physiology plays an essential role in the capacity of the brucellae to establish and maintain long-term intracellular residence in host macrophages. The nature of the Brucella HF-I-regulated genes that have been identified to date suggests that the corresponding gene products contribute to the remarkable capacity of the brucellae to resist the harsh environmental conditions they encounter during their prolonged residence in the phagosomal compartment."

The bacterium is frequently associated with two economically important and epidemiologically distinct reproductive diseases in ruminants: enzootic infectious infertility in cattle owing to Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis and abortions in sheep, goats, and cattle. Septic abortion, usually epizootic in sheep, has been historically associated with C. fetus subsp. fetus and to a lesser extent with Campylobacter jejuni. However, there has been a dramatic species shift in the etiology of Campylobacter abortions in recent years: C. jejuni has now replaced C. fetus subsp. fetus as the predominant cause of sheep abortion in the United States, which appears to be driven primarily by clonal expansion of a hypervirulent tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni clone.

Thus, the relationship of spider cannibalism to food limitation, competition, and population regulation has direct bearing on basic ecological theory and applications such as biological control. This review first briefly treats the different types of spider cannibalism and then focuses in more depth on evidence relating cannibalism to population dynamics and food web interactions to address the following questions: Is cannibalism in spiders a foraging strategy that helps to overcome the effects of a limited supply of calories and/or nutrients? Does cannibalism in spiders reduce competition for prey? Is cannibalism a significant density-dependent factor in spider population dynamics?

Cattle are the most important reservoir for human STEC exposure, and efforts to control the flow of STEC through beef processing have reduced rates of human illness. However, further reduction in human incidence of STEC may require control of the pathogen in cattle populations. The ecology of STEC in cattle production systems is complex and explained by factors that favor (a) colonization in the gut, (b) survival in the environment, and (c) ingestion by another cattle host. Although nature creates seasonal environmental conditions that do not favor STEC transmission in cattle, human efforts to control STEC by environmental manipulation have not succeeded.

Information is needed on how viral genes in general influence phenotypic variance for important viral functions. Changes in global climate will alter the interactions of mosquito species with their primate hosts and with the viruses in domestic cycles, and greater attention should be paid to the sylvatic cycles. There is great danger for the evolution of novel viruses, such as new serotypes, that could compromise vaccination programs and jeopardize public health.

Species interactions in ecological networks can transmit the effects of primary extinctions within and between trophic levels, causing secondary extinctions and extinction cascades. Documenting coextinctions is complicated by ignorance of host specificity, limitations of historical collections, incomplete systematics of affiliate taxa, and lack of experimental studies. Host shifts may reduce the rate of coextinctions, but they are poorly understood. In the absence of better empirical records of coextinctions, statistical models estimate the rates of past and future coextinctions, and based on primary extinctions and interactions among species, network models explore extinction cascades.

We find at the core of these cycles a set of contemporaneous supply and demand surprises that coincided with low inventories and that were magnified by macroeconomic shocks and policy responses. In the next few decades, the world faces the prospect of continued increases in the demand for commodities and greater uncertainty about supply. However, because market participants are likely to respond by increasing inventory holdings and investing in new technologies, we see no reason to expect an increase in the frequency of dramatic commodity booms and busts."

Here, I first consider the constraints and drivers acting on influenza A virus reassortment, including the likelihood of coinfection at the host and cellular levels, mixing and assembly of heterologous gene segments within coinfected cells, and the fitness associated with reassortant genotypes. I then discuss the implications of reassortment for influenza A virus evolution, including its classically recognized role in the emergence of genetically “shifted” pandemic strains as well as its potential role as a catalyst of genetic drift."

Impacts of habitat degradation and fragmentation are likely to be compounded by the social nature of bumble bees and their largely monogamous breeding system, which renders their effective population size low. Hence, populations are susceptible to stochastic extinction events and inbreeding. In North America, catastrophic declines of some bumble bee species since the 1990s are probably attributable to the accidental introduction of a nonnative parasite from Europe, a result of global trade in domesticated bumble bee colonies used for pollination of greenhouse crops. Given the importance of bumble bees as pollinators of crops and wildflowers, steps must be taken to prevent further declines. Suggested measures include tight regulation of commercial bumble bee use and targeted use of environmentally comparable schemes to enhance floristic diversity in agricultural landscapes."

Many migratory species provide ecosystem service benefits to society. For example, insectivorous bats prey on crop pests and reduce the need for pesticides; birds and insects pollinate food plants; and birds afford recreational opportunities to hunters and birdwatchers. Migration is driven by the seasonal availability of resources; as resources in one area become seasonally scarce, individuals move to locations where resources have become seasonally abundant. The separation of the annual lifecycle means that species management and governance is often fractured across international borders. Because migratory species depend on habitat in different locations, their ability to provide ecosystem services in one area depends on the spatial subsidies, or support, provided by habitat and ecological processes in other areas. This creates telecouplings, or interconnections across geographic space, of areas such that impacts to the habitat of a migratory species in one location will affect the benefits enjoyed by people in other locations. Information about telecoupling and spatial subsidies can be used to craft new governance arrangements such as Payment for Ecosystem Services programs that target specific stakeholder groups and locations. We illustrate these challenges and opportunities with three North American case studies: the Duck Stamp Program, Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana), and monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus)."

Our observations challenge this dogma and indicate that heat-stressed animals employ novel homeorhetic strategies to direct metabolic and fuel selection priorities independent of nutrient intake or energy balance. Alterations in systemic physiology support a shift in carbohydrate metabolism, evident through changes such as basal and stimulated circulating insulin levels. Hepatocyte and myocyte metabolism also show clear differences in glucose production and use during heat stress. Perhaps most intriguing, given the energetic shortfall of the heat-stressed animal, is the apparent lack of fat mobilization from adipose tissue coupled with a reduced responsiveness to lipolytic stimuli.

Field studies of plants, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, birds, and mammals demonstrate that the phenomenon indeed does occur in many natural systems. A dilution effect is expected when (a) hosts differ in quality for pathogens or vectors; (b) higher quality hosts tend to occur in species-poor communities, whereas lower quality hosts tend to occur in more diverse communities; and (c) lower quality hosts regulate abundance of high-quality hosts or of vectors, or reduce encounter rates between these hosts and pathogens or vectors. Although these conditions characterize many disease systems, our ability to predict when and where the dilution effect occurs remains poor. The life-history traits that cause some hosts to be widespread and resilient might be correlated with those that promote infection and transmission by some pathogens, supporting the notion that the dilution effect might be widespread among disease systems. Criticisms of the dilution effect have focused on whether species richness or species composition (both being metrics of biodiversity) drives disease risk. It is well established, however, that changes in species composition correlate with changes in species richness, and this correlation could explain why the dilution effect appears to be a general phenomenon."

Because behavioral adaptations are widely considered to rely on changes in synaptic strength, the prevalence of eCB-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD) at synapses throughout the brain merits close attention. The induction and expression of eCB-LTD, although remarkably similar at various synapses, are controlled by an array of regulatory influences that we are just beginning to uncover. This complexity endows eCB-LTD with important computational properties, such as coincidence detection and input specificity, critical for higher CNS functions like learning and memory.

Despite more than 50 years of research, there are conflicting lines of evidence on the role of the environment in influenza A virus (IAV) survival, stability, and transmissibility. With the increasing and looming threat of pandemic influenza, it is important to understand these factors for early intervention and long-term control strategies. The factors that dictate the severity and spread of influenza would include the virus, natural and acquired hosts, virus-host interactions, environmental persistence, virus stability and transmissibility, and anthropogenic interventions. Virus persistence in different environments is subject to minor variations in temperature, humidity, pH, salinity, air pollution, and solar radiations. Seasonality of influenza is largely dictated by temperature and humidity, with cool-dry conditions enhancing IAV survival and transmissibility in temperate climates in high latitudes, whereas humid-rainy conditions favor outbreaks in low latitudes, as seen in tropical and subtropical zones. In mid-latitudes, semiannual outbreaks result from alternating cool-dry and humid-rainy conditions. The mechanism of virus survival in the cool-dry or humid-rainy conditions is largely determined by the presence of salts and proteins in the respiratory droplets. Social determinants of heath, including health equity, vaccine acceptance, and age-related illness, may play a role in influenza occurrence and spread."

This review focuses on two fundamental areas of research in happiness and law, namely alternative measures of happiness and various policies to foster happiness. There are many aspects, concepts, dimensions, and visions of happiness. Empirical findings often depend critically on which particular measure of happiness is analyzed. Happiness studies have applications to national well-being indices; policy evaluation; civil judicial and jury decision making about liability and damages in cases of sexual harassment, employment discrimination, and torts; optimal tax law design; family law; criminal sentencing; legal education; and legal practice. There are decision-making, health, productivity, and psychological benefits to various types of happiness. There are more or less paternalistic happiness interventions, including policies to encourage regular physical exercise, good sleep, and meditation. Hopefully, analysis of these topics offers exemplars of possibilities and limits to utilizing happiness studies in designing legal policy."

Known as priority effects, these effects cause historical contingency in the structure and function of communities, resulting in alternative stable states, alternative transient states, or compositional cycles. The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question: How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained?"

Host restriction involves multiple genetic determinants. Among the known determinants of host range, key determinants have been identified on the genes coding for the nucleoprotein and polymerase proteins that, together with the viral RNA segments, form the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). The RNP genes form host-specific lineages and harbor host-associated genetic signatures. The functional significance of these determinants has been studied by reassortment and reverse genetics experiments, underlining the influence of the global genetic context. In some instances the molecular mechanisms have been approached, pointing to the importance of the polymerase activity and interaction with cellular host factors. Better knowledge of determinants of host restriction will allow monitoring of the pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses."

This conflict has led to the extinction and reduction of numerous species and uncountable human deaths and economic losses. Recent advances in our understanding of conflict have led to a growing number of positive conservation and coexistence outcomes. I summarize and synthesize factors that contribute to conflict, approaches that mitigate conflict and encourage coexistence, and emerging trends and debates. Fertile areas for scholarship include scale and complexity, models and scenarios, understanding generalizable patterns, expanding boundaries of what is considered conflict, using new tools and technologies, information sharing and collaboration, and the implications of global change.

Identification of host proteins that serve as viral receptors has enabled insights into virus particle internalization, host and tissue tropism, and viral pathogenesis. In this review we discuss the most commonly employed methods for virus receptor discovery, specifically highlighting the use of forward genetic screens in human haploid cells. The ability to generate true knockout alleles at high saturation provides a sensitive means to study virus-host interactions. To illustrate the power of such haploid genetic screens, we highlight the discovery of the lysosomal proteins NPC1 and LAMP1 as intracellular receptors for Ebola virus and Lassa virus, respectively. From these studies emerges the notion that receptor usage by these viruses is highly dynamic, involving a programmed switch from cell surface receptor to intracellular receptor. Broad application of genetic knockout approaches will chart functional landscapes of receptors and endocytic pathways hijacked by viruses."

That H2S inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and reduces cell energy production has been known for many decades, but more recently, a number of additional pharmacological targets for this gas have been identified. H2S activates KATP and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels but usually inhibits big conductance Ca2+-sensitive K+ (BKCa) channels, T-type calcium channels, and M-type calcium channels. H2S may inhibit or activate NF-?B nuclear translocation while affecting the activity of numerous kinases including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Akt. These disparate effects may be secondary to the well-known reducing activity of H2S and/or its ability to promote sulfhydration of protein cysteine moieties within the cell."

These mechanisms are usually mediated by antiviral proteins whose expression and activities can be constitutive but are frequently amplified by interferon induction. Among these interferon-stimulated proteins, members of the IFITM (interferon-induced transmembrane) family are unique because they prevent infection before a virus can traverse the lipid bilayer of the cell. At least three human IFITM proteins—IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3—have antiviral activities. These activities limit infection in cultured cells by many viruses, including dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Murine Ifitm3 controls influenza A virus infection in vivo, and polymorphisms in human IFITM3 correlate with the severity of both seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

Found endogenously in genomes as traces of past invasions, retroviruses are also considerable threats to human health when they exist as exogenous viruses such as HIV. The immune response to retroviruses is engaged by germline-encoded sensors of innate immunity that recognize viral components and damage induced by the infection. This response develops with the induction of antiviral effectors and launching of the clonal adaptive immune response, which can contribute to protective immunity. However, retroviruses efficiently evade the immune response, owing to their rapid evolution. The failure of specialized immune cells to respond, a form of neglect, may also contribute to inadequate antiretroviral immune responses. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which immune responses to retroviruses are mounted at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. We also discuss how intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immunity may cooperate or conflict during the generation of immune responses."

Evolutionary impacts most often result from hybridization and introgression but may include diverse changes in native fauna induced by selection. Impact magnitudes observed to date largely range from moderate to major, but massive impacts (including species extinction) are known for a handful of invasive species.

Decisions to attend school seem subject to peer effects and time-inconsistent preferences. Merit scholarships, school health programs, and information about returns to education can all cost-effectively spur school participation. However, distortions in education systems, such as weak teacher incentives and elite-oriented curricula, undermine learning in school and much of the impact of increasing existing educational spending. Pedagogical innovations designed to address these distortions (such as technology-assisted instruction, remedial education, and tracking by achievement) can raise test scores at a low cost. Merely informing parents about school conditions seems insufficient to improve teacher incentives, and evidence on merit pay is mixed, but hiring teachers locally on short-term contracts can save money and improve educational outcomes. School vouchers can cost-effectively increase both school participation and learning."

The latter are typically represented as mRNA, protein, or organic metabolite complements. The theme of this review is that the operational unit of function in complex biological systems is more properly seen as the fully assembled metabolic pathway in the whole organism. Due to the connectivity, interactions, and complexity of metabolic pathways, the measurement of components is an inadequate method for predicting phenotype. Measurement of the outputs of pathways (molecular fluxes) involves different tools than static measures of components, however. Here, we review recently developed stable isotope-mass spectrometric tools for measuring fluxes through metabolic pathways in vivo, focusing on the response to dietary macronutrients (carbohydrates and fats). Methods discussed include measurement of lipid dynamics, DNA replication, hepatic assembly of lipoproteins, and long-lived protein synthesis. Measuring fluxes through multiple pathways concurrently allows regulatory themes to emerge. Use of 2H2O-labeling is emerging as a particularly powerful approach for multiple concurrent biosynthetic flux measurements. Several examples demonstrate that pathway flux results are often unexpected and not predicted by classic biochemistry or the expression of genes and proteins."

These impacts seem most problematic in the stressful and crowded conditions of aquaculture, which increasingly dominates seafood production as wild fishery production plateaus. For instance, marine diseases of farmed oysters, shrimp, abalone, and various fishes, particularly Atlantic salmon, cost billions of dollars each year. In comparison, it is often difficult to accurately estimate disease impacts on wild populations, especially those of pelagic and subtidal species. Farmed species often receive infectious diseases from wild species and can, in turn, export infectious agents to wild species. However, the impact of disease export on wild fisheries is controversial because there are few quantitative data demonstrating that wild species near farms suffer more from infectious diseases than those in other areas.

We explore the effects of such inflammation in metabolic tissues including adipose, liver, muscle, pancreas, and brain and its contribution to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Another area in which many unknowns still exist is the origin or mechanism of initiation of inflammatory signaling in obesity.

Astrocyte-derived ATP modulates synaptic transmission, either directly or through its metabolic product adenosine. d-serine modulates NMDA receptor function, whereas glia-derived glutamate can play important roles in relapse following withdrawal from drugs of abuse. Cell type–specific molecular genetics has allowed a new level of examination of the function of astrocytes in brain function and has revealed an important role of these glial cells that is mediated by adenosine accumulation in the control of sleep and in cognitive impairments that follow sleep deprivation."

This review integrates insights from immunological studies with results of recent genetic genome-wide association studies into a disease model. Genetic data, among others, suggest that viral infections are implicated and that natural killer effector pathways are important in the pathogenesis of CD, but most prominently these data converge with existing immunological findings that CD is primarily a T cell–mediated immune disorder in which CD4+ T cells that recognize gluten peptides in the context of major histocompatibility class II molecules play a central role. Comparison of genetic pathways as well as genetic susceptibility loci between CD and other autoimmune and inflammatory disorders reveals that CD bears stronger resemblance to T cell–mediated organ-specific autoimmune than to inflammatory diseases.

What is immediately apparent as we get better measures is that, between countries, health differences amongst those at older ages are real and large. Countries are ranked differently according to whether one considers life expectancy, prevalence, or the incidence of a specific condition.

The burgeoning field of landscape epidemiology integrates concepts and approaches from disease ecology with the macroscale lens of landscape ecology, enabling examination of disease across spatiotemporal scales in complex environmental settings. We review the state of the field and describe analytical frontiers that show promise for advancement, focusing on natural and human-altered ecosystems. Concepts fundamental to practicing landscape epidemiology are discussed, including spatial scale, static versus dynamic modeling, spatially implicit versus explicit approaches, selection of ecologically meaningful variables, and inference versus prediction. We highlight studies that have advanced the field by incorporating multiscale analyses, landscape connectivity, and dynamic modeling. Future research directions include understanding disease as a component of interacting ecological disturbances, scaling up the ecological impacts of disease, and examining disease dynamics as a coupled human-natural system."

The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, an explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and Borrelia burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi."

These shifts have profound implications for how we must think about law and innovation. Patents, copyrights, noncompete agreements, and trade secret laws are all optimized for an increasingly obsolete worldview. Strong intellectual property impedes, rather than facilitates, innovation when we understand that knowledge flows in learning networks, mixing of market and nonmarket models and motivations, and weaving of commons with property are central to the innovation process."

Intracellularly, the organism prospers in an acidified, phagolysosome-like vacuole. C. burnetii has evolved to replicate in this harsh compartment by a mechanism involving acid activation of metabolism. The ?2 Mb genome of C. burnetii is about twice the size of genomes of most obligate intracellular bacteria, and the organism's central metabolic pathways are largely intact. The absence of extensive genome reduction suggests the adaptation of C. burnetii to an obligate intracellular lifestyle is a recent evolutionary event. Indeed, insight from early work on C. burnetii metabolism, along with new information gained from metabolic pathway reconstructions, nutrient typing, and expression profiling, allowed the rescue of C. burnetii from its host cell to regain the axenic growth capacity of its ancestors. This advance removes the extensive experimental obstacles associated with intracellular obligatism and opens the door for a renaissance in C. burnetii research."

Couples’ interconnectedness can also be leveraged to promote better treatment outcomes. Major themes include the pivotal role of depression and the importance of gender differences in the pathways from the marital relationship to physiological functioning and health. The health risks and benefits of support are weighed. Additionally, two prominent emerging paths from marital distress to poor health are emphasized: sleep problems and metabolic alterations that promote obesity and its comorbidities."

Pathogens mediate plant species coexistence through trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to pathogens and through pathogen specialization. Experimental tests of individual plant–pathogen interactions, tests of feedback through host-specific changes in soil communities, and field patterns and field experimentation consistently identify pathogens as important to plant species coexistence. These direct tests are supported by observations of the role of pathogens in generating the productivity gains from manipulations of plant diversity and by evidence that escape from native pathogens contributes to success of introduced plant species. Further work is necessary to test the role of pathogen dynamics in large-scale patterns of plant diversity and range limits, the robustness of coexistence to coevolutionary dynamics, the contribution of different pathogens, and the role of pathogens in plant succession."

This key reaction is performed by at least four evolutionarily unrelated multigene families. The synthesis of this “neutral lipid” leads to the formation of a lipid droplet, which despite the clear selective advantage it confers is also a harbinger of cellular and organismal malaise. Neutral lipid deposition as a cytoplasmic lipid droplet may be thermodynamically favored but nevertheless is elaborately regulated. Optimal utilization of these resources by lipolysis is similarly multigenic in determination and regulation. We present here a perspective on these processes that originates from studies in model organisms, and we include our thoughts on interventions that target reductions in neutral lipids as therapeutics for human diseases such as obesity and diabetes."

Management recommendations derived from these two literatures are compared and shown to differ due to the way each treats human behaviors. Conventional disease ecology models treat human behaviors as external to the disease system, whereas bioeconomic analysis treats behavior as an internal component of a jointly determined human-disease ecology system. The complexities of animal disease systems, including multiple state variables and imperfect controls, are shown to influence the overall level of optimal disease control, the optimal allocation of controls across species and activities, and long-run outcomes. Eradication is not always optimal, nor may it be optimal to pursue a steady-state outcome. Human responses to disease risks in decentralized settings are also examined.

Parasites infect most marine vertebrate and invertebrate species, and parasites and predators can have comparable biomass density, suggesting they play comparable parts as consumers in marine food webs. Although some parasites might increase with disturbance, most probably decline as food webs unravel. There are several ways to adapt epidemiological theory to the marine environment. In particular, because the ocean represents a three-dimensional moving habitat for hosts and parasites, models should open up the spatial scales at which infective stages and host larvae travel. In addition to open recruitment and dimensionality, marine parasites are subject to fishing, filter feeders, dose-dependent infection, environmental forcing, and death-based transmission. Adding such considerations to marine disease models will make it easier to predict which infectious diseases will increase or decrease in a changing ocean."

This review fills in this gap by providing comprehensive methodological guidance on the quantification of co-impacts and their integration into climate-related decision making based on the literature. The article first clarifies the confusion in the literature about related terms and makes a proposal for a more consistent terminological framework, then emphasizes the importance of working in a multiple-objective–multiple-impact framework. It creates a taxonomy of co-impacts and uses this to propose a methodological framework for the identification of the key co-impacts to be assessed for a given climate policy and to avoid double counting. It reviews the different methods available to quantify and monetize different co-impacts and introduces three methodological frameworks that can be used to integrate these results into decision making. On the basis of an initial assessment of selected studies, it also demonstrates that the incorporation of co-impacts can significantly change the outcome of economic assessments. Finally, the review calls for major new research and innovation toward simplified evaluation methods and streamlined tools for more widely applicable appraisals of co-impacts for decision making."

Strikingly, we observe that marked variations exist in the origin and numerical balance between GABAergic interneurons and the principal cell populations in distinct regions of the telencephalon. Finally we speculate regarding the attractiveness and challenges of establishing a unifying nomenclature to describe inhibitory neuron diversity throughout the telencephalon."

The widespread and rapid growth in CA-MRSA and LA-MRSA has raised the question as to whether MRSA is indeed a food-borne pathogen. The observations on animal-to-animal and animal-to-human transfer of LA-MRSA have prompted research examining the origin of LA-MRSA and its capacity to cause zoonotic disease in humans. This review summarizes the current knowledge about MRSA from food-producing animals and foods with respect to the role of these organisms to act as food-borne pathogens and considers the available tools to track the spread of these organisms. It is clear that LA-MRSA and CA-MRSA and even HA-MRSA can be present in/on food intended for human consumption, but we conclude on the basis of the published literature that this does not equate to MRSA being considered a food-borne pathogen."

Common features of bartonellae include transmission by blood-sucking arthropods and the specific interaction with endothelial cells and erythrocytes of their mammalian hosts. For each Bartonella species, the invasion and persistent intracellular colonization of erythrocytes are limited to a specific human or animal reservoir host. In contrast, endothelial cells are target host cells in probably all mammals, including humans. Bartonellae subvert multiple cellular functions of human endothelial cells, resulting in cell invasion, proinflammatory activation, suppression of apoptosis, and stimulation of proliferation, which may cumulate in vasoproliferative tumor growth. This review summarizes our understanding of Bartonella–host cell interactions and the molecular mechanisms of bacterial virulence and persistence.

However, neurotransmitters are also released asynchronously with a longer, variable delay following an action potential or spontaneously in the absence of action potentials. A compelling body of research has identified roles and mechanisms for synchronous release, but asynchronous release and spontaneous release are less well understood. In this review, we analyze how the mechanisms of the three release modes overlap and what molecular pathways underlie asynchronous and spontaneous release.

During intracellular replication, three functional pairs of two-component systems are sequentially expressed to regulate metabolism, aggregation, and the development of stress-resistance traits for transmission. A type IV secretion effector of E. chaffeensis blocks mitochondrion-mediated host cell apoptosis. Several type I secretion proteins are secreted at the Ehrlichia–host interface. E. chaffeensis strains induce strikingly variable inflammation in mice. The central role of MyD88, but not Toll-like receptors, suggests that Ehrlichia species have unique inflammatory molecules.

We aim to illustrate how uncovering the molecular, anatomical, and physiological characteristics of endocannabinoid signaling has revealed new mechanistic insights into several fundamental phenomena in synaptic physiology. First, we summarize unexpected advances in the molecular complexity of biogenesis and inactivation of the two endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Then, we show how these new metabolic routes are integrated into well-known intracellular signaling pathways. These endocannabinoid-producing signalosomes operate in phasic and tonic modes, thereby differentially governing homeostatic, short-term, and long-term synaptic plasticity throughout the brain. Finally, we discuss how cell type– and synapse-specific refinement of endocannabinoid signaling may explain the characteristic behavioral effects of cannabinoids."

However, recent work on hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus challenges this long-held tenet. Whereas these human pathogens are shed in feces as naked nonenveloped virions, recent studies indicate that both circulate in the blood completely masked in membranes during acute infection. These membrane-wrapped virions are as infectious as their naked counterparts, although they do not express a virally encoded protein on their surface, thus distinguishing them from conventional enveloped viruses. The absence of a viral fusion protein implies that these quasi-enveloped virions have unique mechanisms for entry into cells. Like true enveloped viruses, however, these phylogenetically distinct viruses usurp components of the host ESCRT system to hijack host cell membranes and noncytolytically exit infected cells. The membrane protects these viruses from neutralizing antibodies, facilitating dissemination within the host, whereas nonenveloped virions shed in feces are stable in the environment, allowing for epidemic transmission."

We review evidence from literatures on network effects on technology, labor markets, education, demography, and health; identify several mechanisms through which networks may generate higher levels of inequality than one would expect based on differences in initial endowments alone; consider cases in which network effects may ameliorate inequality; and describe research priorities."

This paradigm holds that a fundamental cause of specific disorders is the misfolding and seeded aggregation of certain proteins. The concept arose from the discovery that devastating brain diseases called spongiform encephalopathies are transmissible to new hosts by agents consisting solely of a misfolded protein, now known as the prion protein. Accordingly, “prion” was defined as a “proteinaceous infectious particle.” As the concept has expanded to include other diseases, many of which are not infectious by any conventional definition, the designation of prions as infectious agents has become problematic. We propose to define prions as “proteinaceous nucleating particles” to highlight the molecular action of the agents, lessen unwarranted apprehension about the transmissibility of noninfectious proteopathies, and promote the wider acceptance of this revolutionary paradigm by the biomedical community."

Although a VLP-based vaccine induces humoral, mucosal, and cellular immunities in animals and currently is in human clinical trials, development of other new vaccine candidates, such as live vectored vaccines, should be considered. Recent evidence suggests that blockage of virus-receptor interaction may be a promising antiviral target. To enhance our capability to combat this important agent, there is an urgent need to develop multidisciplinary, multi-institutional integrated research and to implement food virology education and extension programs nationwide."

Standard tissue culture models lack critical emergent properties driven by cellular organization and in vivo–like function, whereas animal models suffer from limited susceptibility to relevant human viruses and make it difficult to perform detailed molecular manipulation and analysis. Tissue engineering techniques may enable virologists to create infection models that combine the facile manipulation and readouts of tissue culture with the virus-relevant complexity of animal models. Here, we review the state of the art in tissue engineering and describe how tissue engineering techniques may alleviate some common shortcomings of existing models of viral infection, with a particular emphasis on hepatotropic viruses. We then discuss possible future applications of tissue engineering to virology, including current challenges and potential solutions."

These viruses have existed in their hosts, the New World rodents, for millions of years. Their emergence as infectious agents in humans coincided with changes in the environment and farming practices that caused explosions in their host rodent populations. Zoonosis into humans likely occurs because the pathogenic New World arenaviruses use human transferrin receptor 1 to enter cells. The mortality rate after infection with these viruses is high, but the mechanism by which disease is induced is still not clear. Possibilities include direct effects of cellular infection or the induction of high levels of cytokines by infected sentinel cells of the immune system, leading to endothelia and thrombocyte dysfunction and neurological disease. Here we provide a review of the ecology and molecular and cellular biology of New World arenaviruses, as well as a discussion of the current animal models of infection. The development of animal models, coupled with an improved understanding of the infection pathway and host response, should lead to the discovery of new drugs for treating infections."

In addition, development of resistance to nematicides and anthelmintics by these parasites and reduced availability of some nematicides, for environmental protection, pose significant obstacles for current and future prospects of effective parasite control. Due to marked differences in host species, research on animal and plant parasitic nematodes often proceeds independently. Despite the differences between animals and plants, basic cellular properties are shared among these host organisms. Some common properties may be important for mechanisms [homologous or convergent (homoplastic)] by which nematodes successfully infect these diverse hosts or by which animal and plant hosts resist infections by these pathogens.

The magnitudes of these effects differ widely across pest control technologies and the situations in which they are used.

Cellular and humoral immunotolerance to the infecting strain is a unique feature of persistent infection (PI) by ruminant pestiviruses. Persistence, caused by transplacental infection early in fetal development, depends on virally encoded interferon antagonists that inactivate the host’s innate immune response to the virus without globally interfering with its function against other viruses. At epidemiological equilibrium, approximately 1–2% of animals are PI. Successful BVDV control programs show that removal of PI animals results in viral extinction in the host population. The nucleotide sequences of ruminant pestiviruses change little during persistent infection. Nevertheless, they display large heterogeneity, pointing to a long history of virus-host coevolution in which avirulent strains are more successful."

This is a novel, minimally invasive, device-based therapy, specifically targeting and ablating the renal artery nerves with radiofrequency waves without permanent implantation. There are also reported additional benefits in related comorbidities, such as impaired glucose metabolism, renal impairment, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and others. This review focuses on how selective renal sympathetic denervation works, its present and potential therapeutic indications, and its future directions."

RVFV is listed as a select agent with significant potential for international spread and use in bioterrorism. RVFV has caused large, devastating periodic epizootics and epidemics in Africa over the past ?60 years, with severe economic and nutritional impacts on humans from illness and livestock loss. In the past 15 years alone, RVFV caused tens of thousands of human cases, hundreds of human deaths, and more than 100,000 domestic animal deaths. Cattle, sheep, goats, and camels are particularly susceptible to RVF and serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. This review highlights recent research on RVF, focusing on vectors and their ecology, transmission dynamics, and use of environmental and climate data to predict disease outbreaks. Important directions for future research are also discussed."

The increased spread and prevalence of disease are occurring during a period of substantial scientific growth in the vector-borne disease research community. This growth has been supported by advances in genomics and proteomics, and by the ability to genetically alter disease vectors. For the first time, researchers are elucidating the molecular details of vector host-seeking behavior, the susceptibility of disease vectors to arboviruses, the immunological control of infection in disease vectors, and the determinants that facilitate transmission of arboviruses from a vector to a host. These discoveries are facilitating the development of novel strategies to combat arboviral disease, including the release of transgenic mosquitoes harboring dominant lethal genes, the introduction of arbovirus-blocking microbes into mosquito populations, and the development of acquisition- and transmission-blocking therapeutics. Understanding the role of the vector in arbovirus transmission has provided critical practical and theoretical tools to control arboviral disease."

The availability of safe, single-dose, drug treatment regimens capable of suppressing microfilaremia to very low levels, along with improvements in techniques for diagnosing infection, has resulted in the targeting of this major mosquito-borne disease for global elimination. The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000 with the principal objective of breaking the cycles of transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia spp. through the application of annual mass drug administrations (MDAs) to entire at-risk populations. Although significant progress in initiating MDA programs in endemic countries has been made, emerging challenges to this approach have raised questions regarding the effectiveness of using MDA alone to eliminate LF without the inclusion of supplementary vector control. Here, we review advances in knowledge of vector ecology, vector-parasite relationships, and both empirical and theoretical evidence regarding vector management to assess the feasibility and strategic value of including vector control in the GPELF initiative to achieve the global elimination of LF."

Common rules for the strategies employed by both hosts and viruses have emerged from case studies of innate immunity genes in primates.

S. enterica must evade the host's immune system and must also overcome colonization resistance mediated by the pig's indigenous microflora. The inflammatory response against S. enterica provides the bacteria with unique metabolites and is thus exploited by S. enterica for competitive advantage. During infection, changes in the composition of the indigenous microflora occur that have been associated with a breakdown in colonization resistance. Healthy pigs that are low-level shedders of S. enterica also exhibit alterations in their indigenous microflora similar to those in ill animals.

Fueled in part by demographic transitions, unchecked increases in entitlement spending will necessitate some combination of substantial tax increases, elimination of other public spending, or unsustainable public debt. This massive increase in health spending might be warranted if each dollar devoted to the health care sector yielded real health benefits, but this does not seem to be the case. Although we have seen remarkable gains in life expectancy and functioning over the past several decades, there is substantial variation in the health benefits associated with different types of spending. Some treatments, such as aspirin, beta blockers, and flu shots, produce a large health benefit per dollar spent. Other more expensive treatments, such as stents for cardiovascular disease, are high value for some patients but poor value for others. Finally, a large and expanding set of treatments, such as proton-beam therapy or robotic surgery, contributes to rapid increases in spending despite questionable health benefits. Moving resources toward more productive uses requires encouraging providers to deliver and patients to consume high-value care, a daunting task in the current political landscape. But widespread inefficiency also offers hope: Given the current distribution of resources in the US health care system, there is tremendous potential to improve the productivity of health care spending and the fiscal health of the United States."

Building financial sustainability into program reforms has suddenly become a priority. Until just recently, reform efforts focused on creating efficiencies and better quality of services. What emerges from the recent literature is a strong sense that the OECD countries are responding to the financial crisis and the rapid aging of populations in very similar ways.

The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion. The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion. This article reviews current knowledge about the structures and functions of coronavirus spike proteins, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions.

Then came the report of Kamiti River virus from Ae. macintoshi in 1999, followed by worldwide reports of the discovery of other viruses of mosquitoes, ticks, and midges that replicate only in arthropods and not in vertebrates or in vertebrate cells. These viruses (now totaling at least 64 published) have genomes analogous to viruses in various families that include arboviruses and nonarboviruses. It is likely that some of these viruses have been insufficiently studied and may yet be shown to infect vertebrates. However, there is no doubt that the vast majority are restricted to arthropods alone and that they represent a recently recognized clade. Their biology, modes of transmission, worldwide distribution (some have been detected in wild-caught mosquitoes in both Asia and the United States, for example), molecular characteristics of their genomes, and potential for becoming vertebrate pathogens, or at least serving as virus reservoirs, are fascinating and may provide evidence useful in understanding virus evolution. Because metagenomics studies of arthropods have shown that arthropod genomes are the sources of arthropod virus genomes, further studies may also provide insights into the evolution of arthropods. More recently, others have published excellent papers that briefly review discoveries of arthropod viruses and that characterize certain genomic peculiarities, but, to now, there have been no reviews that encompass all these facets. We therefore anticipate that this review is published at a time and in a manner that is helpful for both virologists and entomologists to make more sense and understanding of this recently recognized and obviously important virus group.

The primary population response to reserves is survival to greater ages and sizes plus increases in the population size for harvested species, with greater response to reserves that are large relative to species' movement rates. The primary community response to reserves is an increase in total biomass and diversity, with the potential for trophic cascades and altered spatial patterning of metacommunities.

Rodent models mimic many of the core components of addiction, from the initial drug reinforcement to cue-associated relapse and continued drug intake despite negative consequences. Rodent models have also enabled unprecedented mechanistic insight into addiction, revealing plasticity of glutamatergic synaptic transmission evoked by the strong activation of mesolimbic dopamine—a defining feature of all addictive drugs—as a neural substrate for these drug-adaptive behaviors. Cell type–specific optogenetic manipulations have allowed both identification of the relevant circuits and design of protocols to reverse drug-evoked plasticity and to establish links of causality with drug-adaptive behaviors.

We seek to identify and describe the sources and nature of such risks and methods of thinking about risks that may inform future academic research and policy-making decisions."

Many symbionts, including parasites, pathogens, mutualists, and microbiota, use a combination of both strategies, known as mixed-mode transmission (MMT). Here I review what is known about the evolution, ecology, and epidemiology of symbionts with MMT and compare MMT with our expectations for single-mode strategies. Symbionts with MMT are common and, in comparison with single-mode symbionts, show many surprising features. MMT combines the best of two worlds with regard to the ecological conditions required for persistence and plays a role in the evolution of virulence and genome architecture. Even rare transmission by the minority type of these two transmission modes can make a big difference for the system. This review explores the conceptual issues surrounding the dynamics of mixed-mode symbionts by reviewing literature from the entire range of host and symbiont taxa."

We present brief primers on phylogenetic signal and the analytical tools of phylogenetic ecology. We review the literature and find abundant evidence of phylogenetic signal in pathogens and plants for most traits involved in disease interactions. Plant nonhost resistance mechanisms and pathogen housekeeping functions are conserved at deeper phylogenetic levels, whereas molecular traits associated with rapid coevolutionary dynamics are more labile at branch tips. Horizontal gene transfer disrupts the phylogenetic signal for some microbial traits. Emergent traits, such as host range and disease severity, show clear phylogenetic signals. Therefore pathogen spread and disease impact are influenced by the phylogenetic structure of host assemblages. Phylogenetically rare species escape disease pressure. Phylogenetic tools could be used to develop predictive tools for phytosanitary risk analysis and reduce disease pressure in multispecies cropping systems."

To understand how RNA viruses are able to jump species boundaries and spread in new hosts it is essential to determine the basic processes of evolutionary change in these infectious agents. RNA virus evolution is largely shaped by very high rates of mutation. This, coupled with potentially enormous intra- and interhost population sizes and continual replication, allows the rapid production of genetic diversity, including those mutations that facilitate host adaptation. However, high mutation rates also act to constrain aspects of RNA virus evolution, as the majority of mutations, including many at synonymous sites, are deleterious, which in turn places an upper limit on genome size. Ironically, although RNA viruses are characterized by their mutation rates, these rates may not be high enough to allow the onset of quasispecies dynamics, in which natural selection acts on the viral population as a whole."

The results indicate that the projections, neurochemistry, and receptor and ion channel expression in this cell population vary widely. This review centers on the intrinsic properties and synaptic regulation that control the activity of dopamine neurons. Although all dopamine neurons fire action potentials in a pacemaker pattern in the absence of synaptic input, the intrinsic properties that underlie this activity differ considerably. Likewise, the transition into a burst/pause pattern results from combinations of intrinsic ion conductances, inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs that differ among this cell population. Finally, synaptic plasticity is a key regulator of the rate and pattern of activity in different groups of dopamine neurons. Through these fundamental properties, the activity of dopamine neurons is regulated and underlies the wide-ranging functions that have been attributed to dopamine."

Its incidence among growing segments of the workforce, alongside the recent era of severe economic upheaval, has increased attention to the effects of job loss and unemployment. As a relatively exogenous labor market shock, the study of displacement enables robust estimates of associations between socioeconomic circumstances and life outcomes. Research suggests that displacement is associated with subsequent unemployment, long-term earnings losses, and lower job quality; declines in psychological and physical well-being; loss of psychosocial assets; social withdrawal; family disruption; and lower levels of children's attainment and well-being. Although reemployment mitigates some of the negative effects of job loss, it does not eliminate them. Contexts of widespread unemployment, although associated with larger economic losses, lessen the social-psychological impact of job loss. Future research should attend more fully to how the economic and social-psychological effects of displacement intersect and extend beyond displaced workers themselves."

We debate whether current changes represent a transition or transformation in the relations between science and property. Finally, we argue that just as the public and private spheres of science may be converging, so must future scholarship if we are to answer harder questions about the appropriate balance between traditional logics of open science and the more recent regimes of proprietary science."

Determining the relationship between the monoamine transporters and complex psychiatric disorders has been a particular challenge that is being met by evolving approaches. Elucidating the functional consequences of and interactions among polymorphic sites is advancing our understanding of this relationship.

Because these microbes are mostly vertically transmitted, they have evolved within each human group and provide a view of human ancestry. In particular, we discuss using Helicobacter pylori as a marker of ancestry and migrations. Other organisms with more mixed vertical and horizontal transmission are not suitable to trace migrations with any fidelity. Human mixing affects microbial phylogeographic signals, and lifestyles impact the human microbiome population structure.

The 2013-2015 West African epidemic, by far the most geographically extensive, most fatal, and longest lasting epidemic in Ebola's history, presented an enormous international public health challenge, but it also provided insights into Ebola's pathogenesis and natural history, clinical expression, treatment, prevention, and control. Growing understanding of ebolavirus pathogenetic mechanisms and important new clinical observations of the disease course provide fresh clues about prevention and treatment approaches. Although viral cytopathology and immune-mediated cell damage in ebolavirus disease often result in severe compromise of multiple organs, tissue repair and organ function recovery can be expected if patients receive supportive care with fluids and electrolytes; maintenance of oxygenation and tissue perfusion; and respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular support. Major challenges for managing future Ebola epidemics include establishment of early and aggressive epidemic control and earlier and better patient care and treatment in remote, resource-poor areas where Ebola typically reemerges.

Next, it considers how bounded rationality, fragmented political institutions, resistance from concentrated interests, and fiscal constraints usually lead political leaders to adopt incremental policy changes rather than comprehensive reforms even when faced with serious public health problems. It then identifies conditions under which larger-scale transformation of health policy can occur, focusing on critical junctures in policy development and the role of policy entrepreneurs in seizing opportunities for innovation.

The limited long-run success of government social policies to advance racial justice is due in part to the ad hoc nature of policy responses to various forms of racial discrimination. Drawing on a systems perspective, I show that race discrimination is a system whose emergent properties reinforce the effects of their components. The emergent property of a system of race-linked disparities is über discrimination—a meta-level phenomenon that shapes our culture, cognitions, and institutions, thereby distorting whether and how we perceive and make sense of racial disparities. Viewing within-domain disparities as part of a discrimination system requires better-specified analytic models. While the existence of an emergent system of über discrimination increases the difficulty of eliminating racial disparities, a systems perspective points to strategies to attack that system. These include identifying and intervening at leverage points, implementing interventions to operate simultaneously across subsystems, isolating subsystems from the larger discrimination system, and directly challenging the processes through which emergent discrimination strengthens within-subsystem disparities."

A central term used in historical ecology to situate human behavior and agency in the environment is the landscape, as derived from historical geography, instead of the ecosystem, which is from systems ecology. Historical ecology is similar to nonequilibrium dynamic theory, but differs in its postulate of human-mediated disturbance as a principle of landscape transformation.

I argue that although much of the GDP/gender-inequality relationship can be explained by the process of development, society-specific factors are also at play: Many countries that are poor today have cultural norms that exacerbate favoritism toward males. Norms such as patrilocality and concern for women’s “purity” help explain the male-skewed sex ratio in India and China and low female employment in India, the Middle East, and North Africa, for example.

This success has been attributed to a defect of sorts: high mutation rates (low fidelity) resulting in mutant swarms that allow rapid selection for fitness in new environments. Studies of viruses with small RNA genomes have identified fidelity determinants in viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and have shown that RNA viruses likely replicate within a limited fidelity range to maintain fitness. In this review we compare the fidelity of small RNA viruses with that of the largest RNA viruses, the coronaviruses. Coronaviruses encode the first known viral RNA proofreading exoribonuclease, a function that likely allowed expansion of the coronavirus genome and that dramatically increases replication fidelity and the range of tolerated variation. We propose models for regulation of coronavirus fidelity and discuss the implications of altered fidelity for RNA virus replication, pathogenesis, and evolution."

We argue for the need to focus sustainable consumption initiatives on the key impact areas of consumption—transport, housing, energy use, and food—and at deeper levels of system change. To meet the scale of the sustainability challenges we face, interventions and policies must move from relative decoupling via technological improvements, to strategies to change the behavior of individual consumers, to broader initiatives to change systems of production and consumption.

A key concern is the inadvertent introduction and global spread of agents of myiasis into nonendemic areas, facilitated by climate change and global transport. The incursion of the New World screwworm fly (Cochliomyia hominivorax) into Libya is the most notable of many such range shifts and demonstrates the potential risks of these parasites and the costs of removing them once established in a geographic area. Nevertheless, the insect agents of myiasis can be of societal benefit to forensic science and in medicine as an aid to wound treatment (larval therapy)."

Silman, Przemyslaw Zelazowski",tropical forests in the anthropocene,2014,Annual Review of Environment and Resources,Annual Reviews,"The Anthropocene is characterized as an epoch when human influence has begun to fundamentally alter many aspects of the Earth system and many of the planet's biomes. Here, we review and synthesize our understanding of Anthropocene changes in tropical forests. Key facets include deforestation driven by agricultural expansion, timber and wood extraction, the loss of fauna that maintain critical ecological connections, the spread of fire, landscape fragmentation, the spread of second-growth forests, new species invasion and pathogen spread, increasing CO2, and climate change. The patterns of change are spatially heterogeneous, are often characterized by strong interactions among different drivers, can have both large-scale and remote effects, and can play out through ecological cascades over long timescales. As a consequence, most tropical forests are on a trajectory to becoming altered ecosystems, with the degree of alteration dependent on the intensity and duration of the current bottleneck of human-induced pressures. We highlight the importance of this understanding to develop the strategies necessary for shaping the transition of tropical forests through the early Anthropocene, as well as highlight the opportunities and challenges for the tropical forest science community in the coming decades."
270,Cecilia,YES,NO,Michael F. Antolin,unpacking ?: within-host dynamics and the evolutionary ecology of pathogen transmission,2008,"Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics",Annual Reviews,"Rather than being fixed, pathogen transmission varies and is thus an object of natural selection. I examine how opportunities for selection on pathogen transmission depend on (a) pathogen fitness, (b) genetic variability, and (c) forces acting at within- and between-host levels. The transmission rate, ?, influences processes such as epidemic spread, postepidemic fade-outs, and low-level persistence. Complexity of infection processes within hosts leads to different transmission rates among hosts and between types of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, eukaryotic Protozoa). Generality emerges, however, by “unpacking” ? into within- and between-host opportunities for selection. This is illustrated by evolutionary biology of the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes plague in mammals, remains highly virulent and is transmitted by multiple routes, including fleas and direct contacts with infected hosts. The strength of within-host selection is manifested through infectivity, replication, pathogenicity, and dissemination from hosts. At the between-host level, responses to selection are less predictable because of environmental variation, whereas vector-borne transmission (usually by arthropods) provides additional opportunities for selection and trade-offs between vectors and hosts. In subdivided host populations, selection favors transmission before local pathogen extinction occurs, but key components (e.g. infectious periods of hosts) are determined by within-host dynamics. Pathogen transmission is often viewed in the context of transmission-virulence trade-offs, but within-host dynamics may cause host damage unrelated to transmission, and thus transmission-virulence trade-offs are not universal."

Pigs have genetic and physiological traits similar to humans, which make them one of the most useful and versatile animal models. Owing to these similarities, data generated from porcine models are more likely to lead to viable human treatments than those from murine work. In addition, the similarity in size and physiology to humans allows pigs to be used for many experimental approaches not feasible in mice. Research areas that employ pigs range from neonatal development to translational models for cancer therapy. Increasing numbers of porcine models are being developed since the release of the swine genome sequence, and the development of additional porcine genomic and epigenetic resources will further their use in biomedical research."

The virus is transmitted among small- and medium-sized mammals by ixodid ticks. Human infections occur via spillover from the main transmission cycle(s). Since the late 1990s, the incidence of human disease seems to be increasing. In addition, POW constitutes a genetically diverse group of virus genotypes, including Deer tick virus, that are maintained in distinct enzootic transmission cycles. This review highlights recent research into POW, focusing on virus genetics and ecology and human disease. Important directions for future research are also discussed."

We focus on how advances in mapping, Geographic Information System, and Decision Support System technologies, and progress in spatial and space-time modeling, can be harnessed to prevent and control these diseases. Major themes, which are addressed using examples from tick-borne Lyme borreliosis; flea-borne plague; and mosquito-borne dengue, malaria, and West Nile virus disease, include (a) selection of spatial and space-time modeling techniques, (b) importance of using high-quality and biologically or epidemiologically relevant data, (c) incorporation of new technologies into operational vector and disease control programs, (d) transfer of map-based information to stakeholders, and (e) adaptation of technology solutions for use in resource-poor environments. We see great potential for the use of new technologies and approaches to more effectively target limited surveillance, prevention, and control resources and to reduce vector-borne and other infectious diseases."

The relatively recent emergence of single-stranded DNA viruses, such as chicken anemia virus (CAV) and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), as serious pathogens of eukaryotes is due more to growing awareness than to the appearance of new pathogens or alteration of existing pathogens. In the case of the ubiquitous human circular single-stranded DNA virus family Anelloviridae, there is still no convincing direct causal relation to any specific disease. However, infections may play a role in autoimmunity by changing the homeostatic balance of proinflammatory cytokines and the human immune system, indirectly affecting the severity of diseases caused by other pathogens. Infections with CAV (family Anelloviridae, genus Gyrovirus) and PCV2 (family Circoviridae, genus Circovirus) are presented here because they are immunosuppressive and affect health in domesticated animals. CAV shares genomic organization, genomic orientation, and common features of major proteins with human anelloviruses, and PCV2 DNA may be present in human food and vaccines."

In addition we review the literature exploring the various mechanisms that have been posited to perpetuate poverty. We find sufficient evidence to support the poverty traps hypothesis, suggesting that policies designed to interrupt those self-perpetuating mechanisms merit serious attention."

In the first image, the Third World is defined by a postcolonial racial divide between the former European colonial powers and their decolonized empires. The second image of the Third World is the lingering legacy of the Non-Aligned Movement, which comprised the states outside of the American and Soviet blocs. The third image is that of the less developed world and the continuing struggle between rich and poor, both among and within states. The four forms of security—international, transnational, regional, and internal—encompass interstate conflicts; civil wars, revolutions, and their spillover effects; nationalism and interethnic conflict and the prospect of failed states; the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons; transnational terrorism; the illicit narcotics trade; and perceived negative consequences of globalization."

This principle is especially important for the developing world where millions of women lack access to water for their basic needs. The objectives of this chapter are to summarize what is known about women with respect to water and about water with respect to women as well as to provide a sense of the current debates around these themes. A review of the literature suggests that the lack of gender-disaggregated data on the impacts of water policies, and underlying disagreements on how gender and development should be theorized, makes it difficult to reach robust conclusions on which policies can best assure poor women reliable access to water for their lives and livelihoods."

This is due to several factors, including increased air travel and uncontrolled mosquito vector populations. Emergence can involve simple spillover from enzootic (wildlife) cycles, as in the case of West Nile virus accompanying geographic expansion into the Americas; secondary amplification in domesticated animals, as seen with Japanese encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and Rift Valley fever viruses; and urbanization, in which humans become the amplification hosts and peridomestic mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, mediate human-to-human transmission. Dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika viruses have undergone such urban emergence. We focus mainly on the latter two, which are recent arrivals in the Western Hemisphere. We also discuss a few other viruses with the potential to emerge through all of these mechanisms."

Using the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto as a lens, this paper explores the neoliberalisms and managerialism that render nurses and hotel housekeepers vulnerable, then turns attention to how their affective immaterial labour was simultaneously demanded and dismissed during the outbreak. I argue the affective labour of both nurses and hotel housekeepers is mobilized to perform unquantifiable but essential life-management and that they function as a frontline of the barrier in thwarting the mobility of SARS as an infectious disease. Thus, nurses and hotel housekeepers are precarious gatekeepers, in vulnerable positions as they perform tasks of biosecurity as they monitor borders of transmission."

We present a simple model of aid and public expenditure in which public infrastructure generates an inter-temporal productivity spillover which may exhibit a sector-specific bias. The model also provides for a learning-by-doing externality, through which total factor productivity in the tradable sector is an increasing function of past export volumes. We then use an extended version of this model, calibrated to contemporary conditions in Uganda, to simulate the effect of a step increase in net aid flows. Our simulations show that beyond the short-run, where conventional demand-side Dutch disease effects are present, the relationship between enhanced aid flows, real exchange rates, output growth and welfare is less straightforward than simple models of aid suggest. We show that public infrastructure investment which generates a productivity bias in favour of non-tradable production delivers the largest aggregate return to aid, but it does so at the cost of a deterioration in the income distribution. Income gains accrue predominantly to urban skilled and unskilled households, leaving the rural poor relatively worse off. Under plausible parameterizations of the model the rural poor may also be worse off in absolute terms."

3308,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Moore, Brian",an examination of the unintended consequences in motorcycle helmet laws and organ donation policy,2011,,EconLit,"Chapter 1 is titled ""The Effect of Economic Conditions on Organ Donation"". More than 100,000 individuals in the United States are currently on the organ transplant waiting list, yet surprisingly little is known about the factors that affect organ donation rates. In order to increase our knowledge about the supply of transplantable organs, this paper assesses the effects of economic conditions on deceased organ donations. Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, I estimate that a 1 percentage-point decrease in the unemployment rate is associated with a 3.5 percent increase in the supply of organ donors killed in motor vehicle accidents. Despite evidence of strong cyclical patterns in deaths involving cerebrovascular disease, suicides, and homicides, no correlation was found between the unemployment rate and organ donation rates for these causes of death. Understanding cyclical fluctuations in donations will help policy makers and transplant specialists design policies aimed at increasing the supply of organs by enhancing their knowledge of expected donors. Chapter 2 is titled ""Donorcycles: Motorcycle Helmet Laws and the Supply of Organ Donors"" (with Stacy Dickert-Conlin and Todd Elder). Traffic safety mandates are typically designed to reduce the harmful externalities of risky behaviors. We consider whether motorcycle helmet laws also reduce a beneficial externality by decreasing the supply of viable organ donors. Our central estimates show that organ donations resulting from fatal motor vehicle accidents increase by 10 percent when states repeal helmet laws. Two features of this association suggest that it is causal: first, nearly all of it is concentrated among men, who account for over 90 percent of all motorcyclist deaths, and second, helmet mandates are unrelated to the supply of donors who die in circumstances other than motor vehicle accidents. The estimates imply that every death of a helmetless motorcyclist prevents or delays as many as 0.33 deaths among individuals on organ transplant waiting lists. Chapter 3 is titled ""Not on My Backroads: A Study of Spillover Effects in Motorcycle Helmet Legislation"". Previous research on the effectiveness of motorcycle helmet laws has found a roughly 30% increase in fatalities following the repeal of a universal helmet law. This study examines how motorcycle helmet laws in neighboring states affect fatality rates. Adjacent states with different laws create incentives for motorcyclists from both states to avoid the helmet mandate by riding in the state with the more lenient law. Quantifying the effect additional riders have on fatality rates could provide further justification for government involvement in the decision to wear a helmet. I find that including controls for the relative strength of neighboring states' helmet laws has no effect on fatality rates, nor does it change the estimated effectiveness of a statewide motorcycle helmet mandate. In addition, I find no evidence of a change in the fraction of motorcyclist fatalities involving non-residents following changes in the helmet laws of adjacent states."

Furthermore, the municipalities were assigned the responsibility for exerting primary preventive initiatives. The study investigates, whether the municipalities by applying these opportunities have been able to prevent medication of mental diseases. While an initial simple linear regression indicates a potential relationship between policy opportunities and medication, the relationship vanishes when adjusting for intra-municipal correlation and spatial spillover. Our results demonstrate that linkages between municipal prevention and medication for mental diseases are not only of a simple cause-response nature and indicate that targeted interventions are needed rather than broad and general public health initiatives. Future studies should involve more variables and longer times series in order to obtain proper understandings of linkages between municipal policy efforts and medication."

The data, based on in-depth interviews with 17 adolescents, revealed that the care situation induces both positive and negative changes in family relationships. On the one hand, adolescents showed considerable empathy and respect for the parent who is the primary caregiver and reported that joint involvement in caregiving enhances adolescent–parent bonds. On the other hand, the adolescents lamented restrictions on their own and the family unit''s activities due to the care situation. They also complained about spillover of caregiver stress on other family relationships and about parent-caregivers'' focus of attention on the care recipient. These negative features strongly influenced adolescents'' adaptation to the care situation. Overall, the results confirm the importance of a family systems perspective for understanding of and intervention in family caregiving for demented relatives. Family life educators should convey the importance of family dynamics in caregiving situations to their audiences, and family practitioners should be aware that an exclusive focus on the primary caregiver''s problems may hamper adaptation of other family members (and especially adolescents) who are involved in the care situation."
3317,Joy,NO,NA,"Godman, Brian",changes in the utilization of venlafaxine after the introduction of generics in sweden,2013,Applied Health Economics and Health Policy,EconLit,"Background--There has been an appreciable increase in the prescribing efficiency of proton pump inhibitors, statins, and renin-angiotensin inhibitor drugs in Sweden in recent years. This has been achieved through multiple reforms encouraging the prescription of generics at low prices versus patented drugs in the same class. Generic venlafaxine also presents an opportunity to save costs given the prevalence of depression. However, depression is more complex to treat, with physicians reluctant to change prescriptions if patients are responding to a particular antidepressant. Objectives--We assessed (a) changes in the utilization pattern of venlafaxine versus other newer antidepressants before and after the availability of generic venlafaxine and before and after the initiation of prescription restrictions for duloxetine limiting its prescription to refractory patients, (b) utilization of generic versus original venlafaxine after its availability, and (c) price reductions for generic venlafaxine and the subsequent influence on total expenditure on newer antidepressants over time. Methodology--We performed interrupted time series analysis of changes in monthly reimbursed prescriptions using defined daily doses (DDDs) of patients dispensed at least one newer antidepressant from January 2007 to August 2011. DDDs was defined as the average maintenance dose of a drug when used in its major indication in adults. This included 19 months after the availability of generic venlafaxine and before initiation of prescription restrictions for duloxetine to 13 months after prescription restrictions. Total expenditure and expenditure/DDD for venlafaxine were measured over time. Results--No appreciable change in the utilization pattern for venlafaxine was observed after generic availability when no appreciable demand-side activities by the regions (counties) were implemented to encourage its use. The utilization of venlafaxine significantly increased after prescription restrictions for duloxetine. Generic venlafaxine was dispensed once available, reaching 99.6% of total venlafaxine (DDD basis) by August 2011. There was an appreciable fall in expenditure for newer antidepressants in Sweden after generic venlafaxine despite increased utilization, helped by a 90% reduction in expenditure/DDD for venlafaxine by the end of the study versus prepatent loss prices. Conclusion--Multiple demand-side measures are needed to change physician prescribing habits. Authorities should not rely on a spillover effect between drug classes to effect change. Limited influence of prescription restrictions on the subsequent utilization of duloxetine reflects the complexity of this disease area. This is exacerbated by heterogeneous indications for duloxetine."

At its current rate of spread, the disease will cost the authorities 1 billion pounds in compensation to farmers for slaughtered animals and in administrative expenses over the next decade. The present Coalition government is planning to cull badgers in England because they are the principal wildlife reservoir of bTB and are said to pass infection to cattle.

This article identifies key linkages as priorities for further research, by combining an understanding of both the core common features and the diversity of pastoralist livelihoods with conceptual frameworks from the literature on HIV/AIDS and agriculture: particularly the concepts of susceptibility and resistance (to HIV infection) and vulnerability and resilience (to the socio-economic impacts of AIDS). Features of pastoral livelihoods discussed include: mobility, for grazing, marketing and non-pastoral labour; food insecurity and vulnerability to adverse policy, ‘natural’ and ‘man-made’ disasters; isolation from health services; exposure to zoonotic diseases; labour patterns including traditional institutions to match labour to livestock; reliance on collective action; labour intensive and risky marketing chains. Alors que la compréhension du rapport entre le VIH/SIDA et les moyens d'existence reposant sur l'agriculture s'améliore, il existe peu de recherches sur les liens entre le VIH/SIDA et les systèmes pastoraux, bien que les éleveurs représentent un groupe important de personnes pauvres et vulnérables, aux pays affectés de longue date par le VIH/SIDA. Cet article identifie des relations clés considérées comme prioritaires pour des recherches ultérieures, en combinant une compréhension à la fois des caractéristiques communes essentielles et de la diversité des moyens d'existence des éleveurs. Il utilise des concepts provenant de la littérature sur le VIH/SIDA et sur l'agriculture: notamment les concepts de prédisposition (susceptibility) et de résistance (à l'infection), de vulnérabilité et de resilience (aux effets socio-économiques du SIDA)."

In addition to NTD-listed zoonoses such as rabies, echinococcosis (hydatid disease), leishmaniasis, Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and Taenia solium cysticercosis, the NZDs also include important bacterial zoonoses such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. To date, analysis of the processes that prioritize, develop and deliver zoonoses control programmes in many low- and middle-income countries is lacking, despite its potential to highlight significant evidence gaps and institutional constraints to the intersectoral approach required for their control. Policy process analysis was conducted via a series of semi-structured interviews with key policy actors within various ministries and institutes in Uganda and Nigeria. The study concluded that despite the rhetoric around 'linear' models of health policy development promoting consultation with a wide range of national stakeholders, the decision-making process for zoonotic disease control appears instead overtly influenced by the external political economy of trending pandemic threats, often overlooking national and regional zoonoses priorities. The inclusion of political systems remains a key factor in the zoonoses analysis matrix, enhancing our understanding of the intersectoral and transdisciplinary approaches required for their control. The authors consider policy process analysis to be a fundamental first step of any attempt to holistically strengthen human and animal health systems in a development context, particularly regarding the promotion of integrated control policies for regionally important zoonoses under the growing One Health movement."

The PR-2B DENV-2 produced increased levels of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) relative to genomic RNA during replication.

Genetically, geographically, and temporally, diverse DENV isolates clustered loosely by type, but we found that many are as similar antigenically to a virus of a different type as to some viruses of the same type. Primary infection antisera did not neutralize all viruses of the same DENV type any better than other types did up to 2 years after infection and did not show improved neutralization to homologous type isolates. That the canonical DENV types are not antigenically homogeneous has implications for vaccination and research on the dynamics of immunity, disease, and the evolution of DENV."

Here, with an unprecedented national collection of isolates collected contemporaneously from humans and animals and including a sample of internationally derived isolates, we have used whole-genome sequencing to dissect the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance genes through the course of an epidemic. Contrary to current tenets supporting a single homogeneous epidemic, we demonstrate that the bacterium and its resistance genes were largely maintained within animal and human populations separately and that there was limited transmission, in either direction. We also show considerable variation in the resistance profiles, in contrast to the largely stable bacterial core genome, which emphasizes the critical importance of integrated genotypic data sets in understanding the ecology of bacterial zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance."

Using a three-wave panel sample (N=455) from a large US industrial firm that has undergone numerous downsizing events in the last decade, four alternative causal hypotheses using fully cross-lagged three-wave mediational latent factor models were compared via structural equation modelling. Separate models were analysed for layoff experience and job security perceptions; a motivational factor, escape reasons for drinking, was included in each model. We found large autoregressive effects for problem alcohol use in the stability models. One reason for weak support for spillover models may be that problem alcohol use is more stable over time than previously theorized. All alternative causal models fit the data well; however, the only model comparisons showing significant improvement over the stability models were those including reverse paths. Reverse causal models should be explicitly considered when examining the link between alcohol problems and the workplace. We suggest that, for some workers, problematic alcohol use may be antecedent to, rather than a consequence of, stressful workplace experiences."

Globally coordinated strategies to combat pandemics, similar to current strategies that address climate change, are largely adaptive, in that they attempt to reduce the impact of a pathogen after it has emerged. However, like climate change, mitigation strategies have been developed that include programs to reduce the underlying drivers of pandemics, particularly animal-to-human disease transmission. Here, we use real options economic modeling of current globally coordinated adaptation strategies for pandemic prevention. We show that they would be optimally implemented within 27 years to reduce the annual rise of emerging infectious disease events by 50% at an estimated one-time cost of approximately $343.7 billion. We then analyze World Bank data on multilateral ""One Health"" pandemic mitigation programs. We find that, because most pandemics have animal origins, mitigation is a more cost-effective policy than business-as-usual adaptation programs, saving between $344.0.7 billion and $360.3 billion over the next 100 years if implemented today. We conclude that globally coordinated pandemic prevention policies need to be enacted urgently to be optimally effective and that strategies to mitigate pandemics by reducing the impact of their underlying drivers are likely to be more effective than business as usual."

This paper examines the use of 'contagion' as a model for assessing the dynamics of both episodes: the spread of infection and the diffusion of shock through an intrafinancial system. The argument is put that a discourse of globally 'emerging' and 're-emerging' infection helped to shape a theory of financial contagion, which developed, particularly from 1997, in relation to financial crises in 'emerging markets' in Southeast Asia. Conversely, concerns about the economic impact of a global pandemic have been influential in shaping public health responses to communicable diseases from the early 1990s. The paper argues that tracing the conceptual entanglement of financial and biological 'contagions' is important for understanding the interconnected global environment within which risk is increasingly being evaluated. The paper also considers the consequences of this analogizing for how financial crises are understood and, ultimately, how responses to them are formulated."

The framework involves veterinary service provision at a small fee and has evolved into young graduates setting up veterinary drug shops and practices in the villages, resulting in the promotion of use of products known to help reduce the spread of sleeping sickness. This manuscript describes how fresh graduates who participated in the Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness campaign--a public good implemented by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Makerere University--led to the establishment of small businesses in a community that was just recovering from armed rebellion. The article explains through the use of tables and figures the performance in terms of sales of the small businesses and benefits of the owners in a community that was short of the vital services. The young veterinary graduates have established veterinary drug shops, including the promotion of key people in these small villages trading in chemicals helpful in the control of sleeping sickness by training them to serve as spray persons. The paper discusses the successes and challenges of strengthening the small business model as a sustainability measure in the control of neglected zoonotic diseases like sleeping sickness. The experiences gained have showed that sustainability of disease control in rural communities can be achieved through helping professionals establish a network of small businesses that increase the accessibility of the innovative technologies developed."

The first essay begins by exploring the role of a recent diagnosis of diabetes on the dynamics of several health investment behaviors in older Americans, including smoking, alcohol use, frequent exercise, and the outcome of overweight or obese status. Nine waves of longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study are used. The behavioral response of diagnosed diabetics is compared to a group of individuals who are statistically likely to have high blood sugar levels based on Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. A population average probit model, estimating using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) framework, is used to clarify this relationship. While individuals tend to respond initially by increasing exercise levels and decreasing weight, cigarette and alcohol consumption, the response decreases with time and recidivism is present after initial diagnosis, especially through reduced exercise levels and weight gain. Essays two and three examine family-related (and more specifically, father-related) determinants of child and maternal health outcomes. The second essay uses panel data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to explore how childhood family structure through age 15 (as measured by biological father absence and other male entrance) affects physical and mental health outcomes (including self-reported health status, overweight or obesity status, and depression) smoking behavior during adolescence (Wave I), as well as subsequently into young adulthood (Waves II through IV). Static logit models are estimated to assess the role of family structure on adolescent health outcomes and smoking, whereas discrete-time hazard models are used to estimate changes in these outcomes (e.g.,quitting or starting smoking) after adolescence. These models are estimated separately for boys and girls. Results suggest that while most of the effect of family structure occurs during adolescence, there are residual effects of paternal absence in later life that can discourage smoking and reporting favorable health outcomes. Finally, the third essay uses panel data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) are used to test the hypothesis that increased father involvement as measured through any child support, informal support, in-kind support, and father-child contact (i.e., visitation) can have spillover effects on the mother's mental health, as measured by depression. Maternal depression is an important outcome to consider as it is highly prevalent (especially in families headed by a single mother). Pooled linear probability models and fixed-effects models are estimated to clarify the relationship between various forms of nonresident father involvement on maternal depression. The results suggest that in-kind support is most protective for maternal depression. However, father visitation, especially when done so infrequently, can raise maternal depression levels."

Overall, 92% of veterinary students and 73% of medical students agreed or strongly agreed that 'One Health' was relevant to their desired specialty. Students from both schools largely agreed that interprofessional education should be a goal of the curriculum for their school, and that interprofessional approaches strengthen their overall education. Students reported increased confidence in their communication skills and improved ability to contribute to One Health collaborative teams. This educational intervention, built around a patient case, focused on a variety of learning objectives including skills (such as communication), knowledge (of zoonotic toxoplasmosis) and attitudes (toward collaborative learning and practice). By sparking an interest in One Health during their early professional education, we sought to encourage a new generation of physicians and veterinarians to adopt a more collaborative spirit to their clinical practice, which will ultimately benefit human, animal and environmental health."

This study examines OIE-reported events of these two diseases over a 16-year period to determine the factors that contributed significantly to trade revenue recovery time. Results indicate that the elements influencing a measurable negative export revenue effect due to disease--including risk perceptions and whether the disease is zoonotic--differ from the elements that influence the length of revenue recovery, such as product affordability. In addition, overall global economic health and growing meat demand are elements that matter at the time an event occurs.

The response variable stands for the number of affected by district during the period 2001-2002. The model covariates are: climates (temperature and rainfall), humidity, and surrounding vegetation status. As the environmental and weather data are not available for all the studied districts, Kriging based on linear interpolation was used to estimate the missing data. To account for unexplained spatial variation in the model, we include a stationary Gaussian process S with a powered exponential spatial correlation function. Moran coefficient, DIC criterion and residuals variograms are used to show the high goodness-of-fit of the GLSM. When compared with the statistical tools used in the previous ZCL studies, the optimal GLSM found here yields a better assessment of the impact of the risk factors, a better prediction of ZCL evolution and a better comprehension of the disease transmission. The statistical results show the progressive increase in the number of affected in zones with high temperature, low rainfall and high surrounding vegetation index. Relative humidity does not seem to affect the distribution of the disease in Tunisia.

The ecology, epidemiology, genetics, and evolution of pathogens cannot be fully understood without taking into account the ecology of their hosts. Influenza A viruses have been isolated from many species, including humans, pigs, horses, mink, felids, marine mammals, and a wide range of domestic birds, but wildfowl and shorebirds are thought to form the virus reservoir in nature. The influenza A virus genome consists of eight segments of negative-stranded RNA, which code for 11 proteins. Influenza viruses are classified on the basis of two of these proteins expressed on the surface of virus particles; the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins.

3358,Joy,NO,NA,"Carpenter, Tim E.",how can animal disease risks be better managed?,2012,EuroChoices,EconLit,"Livestock farming is imbued with a variety of disease-related risks. The threat of disease, and actions taken (or not taken) to mitigate it, can impact both the broader livestock sector and potentially society at large if the disease is what is termed zoonotic, i.e., impacting both animal and human health alike. Understanding the nature of these risks is crucial to improve policymaking and requires multidisciplinary toolkits. In this article we identify various frameworks from economics and epidemiology to analyze the impact of animal disease risks in livestock environments. From this, we examine the policy responses implemented to better manage risk, and conclude by identifying the current gaps in the decision process related to risk and uncertainty, which is a reflection of imperfect knowledge. Recent advances in our modeling frameworks have helped streamline the complex decision space faced by policymakers and improved our understanding of the risks and consequences of mitigation strategies. At the same time, while there has been significant progress in integrating economic and epidemiological tools to analyze risk, more work is required to understand the feedbacks between disease and behaviour taken to control it."

Nevertheless, communicable diseases remain an important public health issue in the region. In December 2009, within the framework of its Regional Programming for Asia (2007-2013), the European Union (EU) launched a Regional Program on Highly Pathogenic and Emerging Diseases (HPED) in Asia.

Assessing this interregional initiative, the main objective of this paper is to shed light on the nature and functions of health interregionalism between Asia and Europe and its influence on regional health governance. It concludes that while in the specific context of the EU-ASEAN HPED program, health interregionalism had varied functions and a substantial influence on regional health governance, this initiative did not use the full potential that interregional health mechanism may provide to influence the development of another region or to promote the EU's specific actorness in regional and global health."
3362,Joy,NO,NA,"Perevodchikov, Evgeniy",invasive species outbreaks and international trade,2009,,EconLit,"Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) is a vesicular disease that affects all cloven-hoofed animals caused by a virus that spreads through air, contaminated meat, and animal contacts. Due to its highly contagious nature, it is considered to be the most devastating livestock disease. Its outbreaks result in a loss of export markets by an infected country and present significant containment and eradication costs. Governmental agencies provide inspection and quarantine services prior to outbreak (ex ante) to prevent the introduction of the disease across national borders and enforces eradication policies following an outbreak (ex post). This research presents two models to analyze both ex ante and ex post decisions of FMD control, and an empirical application to the data on FMD outbreaks of the information theoretic estimators. The first paper presents how location, spatial spillover effects, trade, and different control incentives across borders might prevent complete eradication of FMD outbreaks and undermine the potential success of disease control programs. Border inspection is crucial to protect the domestic livestock industry against incursion of the disease. A spatial game theoretic framework is applied to compare disease control strategies chosen under centralized and decentralized decision models for a cluster of spatially adjacent countries. The results show that spatial spillover effects are ignored and socially inferior control strategies are chosen under decentralized decision model. The probability of outbreak is smaller and the socially optimal levels of control effort and expected payoffs are greater under centralized decision model. Intervention might be required to change individual payoffs to incorporate spatial interactions and efficiently mitigate FMD outbreaks. The second paper evaluates alternative mitigation measures following an outbreak in a stochastic optimal control bioeconomic-epidemiological model under uncertainty of a potential entry and spread of the disease. The conceptual model captures the intertemporal welfare impacts of mitigation measures and integrates dynamic livestock production, disease dissemination, domestic consumption, and international trade. The model is applied to the case of a hypothetical outbreak in Canada. Since Canada exports around 50% of its beef production, a potential outbreak is a major policy concern. The mitigation scenarios including stamping-out, movement controls, and preemptive slaughter are evaluated. Results show that, under stamping-out and movement controls mitigation measures, as the level of preemptive slaughter increases from 30% to 90% of latent infectious cattle, the total welfare loss from an outbreak decreases from $171 billion to $16 billion. The third paper proposes a generalized information theoretic estimator for the regression model with the first order spatial autoregression in the dependent variable. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments are used to compare finite sample performance of traditional and three information theoretic estimators including maximum empirical likelihood, maximum empirical exponential likelihood, and maximum log Euclidean likelihood. Finite sample performance of Wald, Likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier tests constructed from these estimators is examined.

To discuss this recommendation, the authors convened a group of IBC chairs, scientists, and administrative staff from our six universities on May 11. The authors hope that the fruits of their deliberation will be considered by the National Scientific Advisory Board on Biosecurity, which will meet for the first time on June 30. Many scientists believe publication was appropriate, but it is far from clear that the case for open science has been made successfully with the general public, law enforcement officials, or elected officials. They are concerned that IBCs today might face a situation similar to resource-starved Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in the late 1990s. IRBs received attention only after human research was conspicuously shut down at major research institutions. IBCs will need resources, training, and guidance to ensure that resources devoted to research on biodefense and emerging infections are used effectively, and that public trust and accountability are preserved."

While not wanting to minimize the very real threat to human health that cross-species organ transplantation could pose, these fears will be read as symbolic statements that may reveal anxieties about our perception of human nature and the spatialized ways in which we have constructed relationships between ourselves and other animals. This theme is addressed by considering the symbolism associated with transplantation and xenotransplantation and fears of pollution and disease. It is argued that the perceived transgression of boundaries implied in animal to human organ transplantation and that fears about zoonosis may activate anxieties of “the beast within,” an anxiety that may speak of our uncertain and uneasy conquest of culture over nature."

It facilitates both the rapid design and evaluation of new and emerging vaccines and identifies individuals unlikely to be protected by vaccine. We describe a general-purpose machine-learning framework, DAMIP, for discovering gene signatures that can predict vaccine immunity and efficacy. DAMIP is a multiple-group, concurrent classifier that offers unique features not present in other models: a nonlinear data transformation to manage the curse of dimensionality and noise; a reserved-judgment region that handles fuzzy entities; and constraints on the allowed percentage of misclassifications. Using DAMIP, implemented results for yellow fever demonstrated that, for the first time, a vaccine's ability to immunize a patient could be successfully predicted (with accuracy of greater than 90 percent) within one week after vaccination. A gene identified by DAMIP, EIF2AK4, decrypted a seven-decade-old mystery of vaccination. Results for flu vaccine demonstrated DAMIP's applicability to both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Results in a malaria study enabled targeted delivery to individual patients. Our project's methods and findings permit highlighting and probabilistically prioritizing hypothesis design to enhance biological discovery. Moreover, they guide the rapid development of better vaccines to fight emerging infections, and improve monitoring for poor responses in the elderly, infants, or others with weakened immune systems. In addition, the project's work should help with universal flu-vaccine design."

Various information systems (IS) projects have been undertaken to enhance public health capacity for detecting EID in a timely manner and disseminating important public health information to concerned parties. While those initiatives seemed to offer promising solutions, public health researchers and practitioners raised concerns about their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we argue that the concerns about current public health IS projects are partially rooted in the lack of a comprehensive framework that captures the complexity of EID management to inform and evaluate the development of public health IS. We leverage loose coupling to analyze news coverage and contact tracing data from 479 patients associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan. From this analysis, we develop a framework for outbreak management. Our proposed framework identifies two types of causal circles—coupling and decoupling circles—between the central public health administration and the local capacity for detecting unusual patient cases. These two circles are triggered by important information-centric activities in public health practices and can have significant influence on the effectiveness of EID management. We derive seven design guidelines from the framework and our analysis of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan to inform the development of public health IS. We leverage the guidelines to evaluate current public health initiatives. By doing so, we identify limitations of existing public health IS, highlight the direction future development should consider, and discuss implications for research and public health policy."

Statistical modeling shows that protective HA imprinting is the crucial explanatory factor, and it provides 75% protection against severe infection and 80% protection against death for both H5N1 and H7N9. Our results enable us to predict age distributions of severe disease for future pandemics and demonstrate that a novel strain’s pandemic potential increases yearly when a group-mismatched HA subtype dominates seasonal influenza circulation. These findings open new frontiers for rational pandemic risk assessment."
3379,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Oleson, Jacob J.",predicting infectious disease outbreak risk via migratory waterfowl vectors,2013,Journal of Applied Statistics,EconLit,"The spread of an emerging infectious disease is a major public health threat. Given the uncertainties associated with vector-borne diseases, in terms of vector dynamics and disease transmission, it is critical to develop statistical models that address how and when such an infectious disease could spread throughout a region such as the USA. This paper considers a spatio-temporal statistical model for how an infectious disease could be carried into the USA by migratory waterfowl vectors during their seasonal migration and, ultimately, the risk of transmission of such a disease to domestic fowl. Modeling spatio-temporal data of this type is inherently difficult given the uncertainty associated with observations, complexity of the dynamics, high dimensionality of the underlying process, and the presence of excessive zeros. In particular, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the waterfowl migration are developed by way of a two-tiered functional temporal and spatial dimension reduction procedure that captures spatial and seasonal trends, as well as regional dynamics. Furthermore, the model relates the migration to a population of poultry farms that are known to be susceptible to such diseases, and is one of the possible avenues toward transmission to domestic poultry and humans. The result is a predictive distribution of those counties containing poultry farms that are at the greatest risk of having the infectious disease infiltrate their flocks assuming that the migratory population was infected. The model naturally fits into the hierarchical Bayesian framework."

Our annual difference-in-differences estimation reveals that the rollout of the dispensaries across Danish cities led to a 19 percent decline in the TB mortality rate, but exhibits no significant impacts on other diseases in placebo regressions. We next take advantage of the dispensaries' explicit targeting on TB to set up a triple-differences model which exploits other diseases as controls and obtain a similar magnitude of the effect. Using monthly mortality data in a similar strategy leads to the same conclusion. In addition, we find small positive spillover effects of the dispensaries on productivity as measured by annual income per taxpayer at the city level, digitized from historical tax-assessment records. Overall, the evidence highlights the provision of personalized information on infectious diseases as a cost-effective cause of the historical mortality decline."

The analysis uses data from the universe of birth records in seven Argentine provinces for 2004 to 2008 and exploits the geographic phasing in of Plan Nacer over time. The paper finds that the program increases the use and quality of prenatal care as measured by the number of visits and the probability of receiving a tetanus vaccine. Beneficiaries' probability of low birth-weight is estimated to be reduced by 19 percent. Beneficiaries have a 74 percent lower chance of in-hospital neonatal mortality in larger facilities and approximately half this reduction comes from preventing low birth weight and half from better postnatal care. The analysis finds that the cost of saving a disability-adjusted life year through the program was $814, which is highly cost-effective compared with Argentina's $6,075 gross domestic product per capita over this period. Although there are small negative spillover effects on prenatal care utilization of non-beneficiary populations in clinics covered by Plan Nacer, no spillover is found onto their birth outcomes."

Researchers have shown that the mosquitoes exhibit a shift in feeding behavior when the robins disperse after breeding. In early summer, about half of the mosquitoes' blood meals come from the robin, despite house sparrows being common and susceptible to infection. Integrating available data into a model based on a shift in mosquito feeding preference leads to the prediction that the peak transmission of WNV to humans should occur by late July to mid-August and then decline in early October when cold weather hampers mosquito activity. Seasonal shifts in mosquito feeding behavior occur across the United States and appear to intensify epidemics of several avian zoonotic viruses, not only WNV but also Western equine encephalitis virus, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, and possibly other vector-borne pathogens."

When who-infects-whom is observed, we derive a profile likelihood maximized over all possible baseline hazard functions that is similar to the Cox partial likelihood. When who-infects-whom is not observed, we derive an EM algorithm to maximize the profile likelihood integrated over all possible combinations of who-infected-whom. This extends the most important class of regression models in survival analysis to infectious disease epidemiology.

These new health challenges have transnational implications and involve a large range of actors and stakeholders. National governments no longer hold the sole responsibility for the health of their people. These changes in health trends have led to the rise of global health governance as a theoretical notion for health policy making. The Southeast Asian region is particularly prone to public health threats such as emerging infectious diseases and faces future health challenges including those of noncommunicable diseases. This study looks at the potential of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a regional organization to lead a regional dynamic for health cooperation in order to overcome these challenges. Through a comparative study with the regional mechanisms of the European Union (EU) for health cooperation, we look at how ASEAN could maximize its potential as a global health actor. Our study is based on primary research and semistructured field interviews. To illustrate our arguments, we refer to the extent of regional cooperation for health in ASEAN and the EU for (re)emerging infectious disease control and for tobacco control. We argue that regional institutions and a network of civil society organizations are crucial in relaying global initiatives, and ensuring the effective implementation of global guidelines at the national level. ASEAN's role as a regional body for health governance will depend both on greater horizontal and vertical integration through enhanced regional mechanisms and a wider matrix of cooperation."
3398,Joy,NO,NA,"Lee, Katherine",spatial considerations in the economics of prevention and control of biological invasions,2016,,EconLit,"Introductions of biological invaders are often a consequence of economic activity or human action. Invasive species and pathogens pose significant threats to both the environment and society. Preventing and managing invaders is an interdisciplinary problem; it cannot be achieved solely through use of economic analysis nor just consideration of system biology or ecology. Human action and the environmental responses are interconnected and should be studied as such. Proper specification of models to address prevention and management require an understanding of species biology and system ecology, which are both influenced by human and environmental factors. This dissertation presents three essays on the economics of prevention and management of biological invasions with an emphasis on how space plays a role in introduction drivers and damage magnitudes. The questions addressed herein require consideration of biological, ecological, and economic processes to inform prevention and control policy. The first two essays explore the consequences of ignoring health risks resulting from land use change over time and space. The third essay addresses producer response to heterogeneous contamination risk in live animal input markets. The concept that a number of infectious diseases such as malaria, Ebola, and Zika virus are linked to changes in anthropogenic land use is becoming widely known and accepted. However, infectious disease is rarely considered as a cost in land use decision-making. Chapter 1 develops a model that includes the health consequences of land conversion decisions. A dynamic harvest model is used to determine an optimal rate and area of land conversion that accounts for the benefits and consequences of environmental conversion, including increased prevalence of malaria. Simulations indicate the cost of ignoring the change in malaria prevalence as a consequence of land use change can create significant welfare losses and that this ignored cost of conversion should be factored into policy making. The second chapter builds on the results of Chapter 1; health consequences arising from land use change are great enough to alter the net benefits of land conversion. Chapter 2 addresses whether risk of infectious disease modifies the optimal patterns and timing of land 1 conversion. The dynamic model developed in this chapter allows for different time paths and areas of conversion across land units or regions, where any differences in conversion patterns are driven by spatial orientation of the land units. When the costs of infectious disease are correlated with patterns of land conversion, the optimal sites of land conversion are altered. Location of conversion can be used as a first step in mitigating health risks of altered landscapes and the patterns are dependent on magnitude of the disease costs. The results of this chapter are consistent with recommendations of ecologists and epidemiologists to strategically select conversion patterns by considering the ecological impacts of land use decisions. Chapter 3 models producer response to information about contamination risk in live animal import markets. Trade and movement of live animals and animal products drive the introduction and spread of a number of zoonotic and livestock diseases. Existing trade policies are geared toward minimizing the risk of introducing a pest or pathogen by banning imports from specific sources. Understanding how agents behave in a decentralized environment can give insight into how to create targeted policies for minimizing risk. The model examines the trade-offs faced by importers when choosing where to source live and risky inputs to production. Simulations using data from the live cattle trade industry give insight into how and when importers substitute away from high-risk sources. The magnitude of substitution varies by the amount of information the importer uses in its risk estimation. The value to risk trade-off can be measured as an elasticity, detailing how individual producers respond to risk.

In later-life marriages, where both spouses are more likely to have health challenges, there is an increased likelihood that health symptoms from both spouses affect each other. In the current study we examined how health symptoms in a ""healthy"" spouse may exacerbate health problems in a partner (the patient) who is managing multiple chronic illnesses. Surveys were collected across 14 days from 27 later-life couples where patients had both diabetes and osteoarthritis. Results indicated that higher healthy spouse symptoms were generally associated with higher patient symptoms, suggesting a spillover effect. Spouse reports of positive and negative mood were inversely linked with patient health outcomes. Spouse reports of higher positive marital interactions were surprisingly linked with higher patients' arthritis activity and activity limitations, possibly indicating a compensatory effect where marital interactions increase with symptoms. Daily spouse reports of positive marital interactions and mood were linked with patient health outcomes even after the spillover of health symptoms was taken into account."

Despite the scale of this threat, there are inherent limitations in preventing and controlling EIDs, including the scope of current disease surveillance efforts. All of this leads to the following questions in the context of Mexico's recent swine flu experience: What were the cultural, political, and economic challenges to Influenza A/H1N1 virus response in Mexico? By way of comparison, what can we learn from the U.S. experience in 1976 with A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1), later referred to as H1N1? This article explores the comparative political economy of Mexico's handling of influenza virus A/H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Research provides notable observations -- based on the strengths and weaknesses of each country's response -- that can be used as a starting point of discussion for the design of effective EIDs surveillance programs in developing and middle-income countries. In the U.S., the speed and efficiency of the 1976 U.S. mobilization against H1N1 was laudable. Although the U.S. response to the outbreak is seldom praised, the unity of the scientific and political communities demonstrated the national ability to respond to the situation. Mexico's strongest characteristics were its transparency, as well as the cooperation the country exhibited with other nations, particularly the U.S. and Canada. While Mexico showed savvy in its effective management of public and media relations, as the article details, political, economic, and cultural problems persisted."
3404,Joy,NO,NA,Jianguo Liu,systems integration for global sustainability,2015,Science,Sociological Collection,"BACKGROUND: Many key global sustainability challenges are closely intertwined (examples are provided in the figure). These challenges include air pollution, biodiversity loss, climate change, energy and food security, disease spread, species invasion, and water shortages and pollution. They are interconnected across three dimensions (organizational levels, space, and time) but are often separately studied and managed. Systems integration—holistic approaches to integrating various components of coupled human and natural systems (for example, socialecological systems and human-environment systems) across all dimensions—is necessary to address complex interconnections and identify effective solutions to sustainability challenges. ADVANCES: One major advance has been recognizing Earth as a large, coupled human and natural system consisting of many smaller coupled systems linked through flows of information, matter, and energy and evolving through time as a set of interconnected complex adaptive systems. A number of influential integrated frameworks (such as ecosystem services, environmental footprints, human-nature nexus, planetary boundaries, and telecoupling) and tools for systems integration have been developed and tested through interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary inquiries. Systems integration has led to fundamental discoveries and sustainability actions that are not possible by using conventional disciplinary, reductionist, and compartmentalized approaches. These include findings on emergent properties and complexity; interconnections among multiple key issues (such as air, climate, energy, food, land, and water); assessment of multiple, often conflicting, objectives; and synergistic interactions in which, for example, economic efficiency can be enhanced while environmental impacts are mitigated. In addition, systems integration allows for clarification and reassignment of environmental responsibilities (for example, among producers, consumers, and traders); mediation of trade-offs and enhancement of synergies; reduction of conflicts; and design of harmonious conservation and development policies and practices. OUTLOOK: Although some studies have recognized spillover effects (effects spilling over from interactions among other systems) or spatial externalities, there is a need to simultaneously consider socioeconomic and environmental effects rather than considering them separately. Furthermore, identifying causes, agents, and flows behind the spillover effects can help us to understand better and hence manage the effects across multiple systems and scales. Integrating spillover systems with sending and receiving systems through network analysis and other advanced analytical methods can uncover hidden interrelationships and lead to important insights. Human-nature feedbacks, including spatial feedbacks (such as those among sending, receiving, and spillover systems), are the core elements of coupled systems and thus are likely to play important roles in global sustainability. Systems integration for global sustainability is poised for more rapid development, and transformative changes aimed at connecting disciplinary silos are needed to sustain an increasingly telecoupled world."

Gall flies have been introduced in an attempt at biological control of the plant. The gall flies lay their eggs in the flower heads, where the larvae induce the formation of galls in which they overwinter. Although the flies have successfully dispersed throughout populations of the invasive weed, they have not proved to be effective control agents, and the weed continues to spread, particularly in areas disturbed by human activity. Researchers have discovered that therein lies a deeper threat. The fly grubs have proved to be an attractive food source for Peromyscus mice and bolster mouse populations during otherwise lean winter months. This genus of mice are reservoir hosts for the human pathogenic hantavirus, Sin Nombre, and, worryingly, the authors found that the abundance of hantavirus-seropositive mice is elevated in zones of high abundance of weed and flies. Deer mice also act as reservoir hosts for Lyme disease and potentially for plague and other zoonotic pathogens."

Using the exact timing of vaccination relative to birth, we estimate the effects of local pertussis outbreaks occurring in-utero and during the first two months of life on the likelihood of on-time initial immunization for pertussis and other immunizations. We find that parents respond to changes in perceived disease risk: pertussis outbreaks within a state increase the rate of on-time receipt of the pertussis vaccine at two months of age. This response is concentrated among low-socioeconomic status (SES) subgroups. In addition, we find that pertussis outbreaks increase the likelihood of immunization against other vaccine-preventable diseases. These spillover effects are almost as large the direct effects and are present only for vaccines that are typically given during the same visit as the pertussis vaccine, which suggests that healthcare access costs play an important role in parents' vaccination decisions."

That is, it is endemic only in certain areas of the globe, with environmental and climatic characteristics that are ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes, which are the vector for transmitting the disease. This feature is the main reason why a large body of economic literature uses mortality from malaria as a proxy with which to measure the effect of geography on human outcomes. Cases of eradication are being scrutinized by scholars to determine the socioeconomic impacts of malaria. Among the various malaria parasites, the worst, Plasmodium falciparum, infested Italian regions for centuries until its eradication in the period 1945-50. This article presents an empirical assessment of the economic outcomes of the eradication of malaria in the Italian regions by exploiting the spatial variation in mortality rates. I found support for the hypothesis that the eradication of malaria increases human capital in the long run. In particular, I found that eradication increased the years of schooling by about 0.3 years, although my evidence suggests a greater effect on males than on females. Moreover, I found support for a long-run impact of eradication actions that operated through an intergenerational spillover effect and accounted for about 0.07 years of schooling."

Malaria is considered to be strictly related to poverty and its geographically-related origin is now widely recognized, i.e. it is endemic only in certain areas of the globe whose environmental and climatic characteristics are ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes which are the vector for the transmission of the disease. The World Health Organization is currently setting a series of policies aiming to eradicate the disease from Africa, with the specific goals to preserve human lives and possibly to boost economic growth in those areas. Among the several malaria parasites, the worst, Plasmodium falciparum, has infested Italian regions for centuries until the complete eradication occurred in the period 1945-1950. In this paper I provide an empirical assessment of the economic outcomes of malaria eradication in Italian regions. By making use of both macroeconomic and microeconomic data, I found support to the hypothesis that malaria eradication boosts productivity growth and that in the long run it leads to an increase in human capital. In particular, I found that the presence of malaria reduced significantly regional growth over the period 1891-1961, while its eradication increased the years of schooling for both males and females respectively, although my evidence points at a larger support for a very long run impact of eradication actions through an intergenerational spillover effect."

As few as five amino acid substitutions, or four with reassortment, might be sufficient for mammal-to-mammal transmission through respiratory droplets. From surveillance data, we found that two of these substitutions are common in A/H5N1 viruses, and thus, some viruses might require only three additional substitutions to become transmissible via respiratory droplets between mammals. We used a mathematical model of within-host virus evolution to study factors that could increase and decrease the probability of the remaining substitutions evolving after the virus has infected a mammalian host. These factors, combined with the presence of some of these substitutions in circulating strains, make a virus evolving in nature a potentially serious threat. These results highlight critical areas in which more data are needed for assessing, and potentially averting, this threat."

This approach constitutes a rigorous methodology for health-impact assessment, providing a quantitative measure of the stability of the region. Contrary to entrenched cultural assumption, affluent suburban counties and impoverished central-city neighborhoods remain strongly linked through a probability-of-contact matrix well indexed by the daily journey to work. The public-health ecology of the New York Metropolitan Region is remarkably unstable, greatly amplifying perturbations through mechanisms analogous to positive feedback in mechanical systems, with the single greatest influence being the percentage of the population living in poverty. Given the New York region's overwhelming dominance of national patterns for the hierarchical diffusion of disease and disorder this result has significant policy implication.

3425,Joy,NO,NA,"Khazabi, Massoud",three essays on r&d investment,2011,,EconLit,"The dissertation consists of three essays on industrial organization. The first essay titled ""Fundamental Sources of Long-run Labour Productivity Improvements in Canada"" examines the importance of the public infrastructure as a source of growth in labour productivity in the Canadian economy within the last four decades. Time series data are used to develop an econometric model to capture the interaction among labour productivity, R&D investments, the public infrastructure, and trade openness. Extensive tests of data quality, choice of model, and stability of the model are performed to enrich the research. The results suggest that the type of capital involved has a significant effect on the extent of labour productivity and growth. Innovation, the major characteristic of a knowledge-based economy, improves labour productivity both in the short and long run. The effect of trade openness is also discussed in depth. The second paper titled ""Competition and Innovation with Horizontal R&D Spillovers"" extends a theoretical framework for analyzing competition and innovation in presence of horizontal spillovers. Introducing two scenarios, it is shown that when firms behave non-cooperatively in both the R&D and production stages, (i) the degree of spillover has a negative relationship with the effective and respective R&D expenditures of each firm as well as the level of social welfare; (ii) the relationship between the number of firms and the respective and effective R&D expenditure of each firm is negative. It also has a negative relationship with the level of social welfare: an inverted-U relationship when the benefits of R&D are low and a steady negative relationship when R&D technology is very productive. When firms behave cooperatively in the R&D stage, and non-cooperatively in the production stage, (i) the relationship between the R&D expenditure of the joint research lab and the number of firms in the market is negative, and (ii) in the limit, there would be no innovation in the market when the number of firms tends to infinity. It is also shown that when there are more than one firm in the market, allowing them to cooperate in the R&D stage, but not in the production stage, yields a level of social welfare that is higher than the social welfare level obtained when the firms behave non-cooperatively in both stages of the game. The third paper titled ""The Search for New Drugs: A Theory of R&D in the Pharmaceutical Industry"" formalizes, in a rigorous manner, the concept of information externalities, by modeling R&D activities as the process of searching for a drug to treat a disease, with R&D activities being modeled from the perspective of the theory of optimal search. In conventional models of patent design, only one brand--the brand with the highest quality--is available on the market at any time. Furthermore, demand is completely inelastic: each consumer, regardless of income and regardless of the price of the brand offered on the market, buys exactly one unit of the brand. In this model, which is a dynamic model in continuous time, several differentiated products--the products whose patents are still in force and the products whose patents have expired--are available at any time on the market. Furthermore, the demand for a brand depends on income, its own price, and the prices of the other brands. The analyses of R&D as well as the impact of the cost and the quality of newly discovered drugs on the market are represented under this framework, when the pharmaceutical firms with an active drug discovery program behave strategically in both R&D and in the product market."

Purpose--To examine heterogeneity in spillover effects of chronic conditions on family members by type of familial relationship with patient. Methods--Adults (aged>/=18 years) and adolescents (aged 13-17 years) who had a parent, spouse, or child in their household with a chronic condition (Alzheimer's disease/dementia, arthritis, cancer, or depression) were recruited from a US national panel to participate in an on-line survey. Respondents were asked to rate the spillover effect of their family member's illness on their own health on a 0-100 scale, with lower scores indicating greater spillover. Regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between rating scale scores and relationship with an ill family member (ill parent, child, or spouse) for each illness separately, controlling for caregiving responsibility and the health status of the ill family member. Results--A total of 1,267 adults and 102 adolescents met inclusion criteria. In adjusted analyses, having a sick child was significantly (p<0.05) associated with lower rating scale scores compared with having a spouse with the same condition (cancer: -24.2; depression -9.7). Having a non-elderly or elderly adult parent with a condition, compared with a spouse, was significantly associated with lower rating scale scores for arthritis (-3.8) and depression (-5.3), but not for Alzheimer's disease/dementia or cancer. Conclusions--The impact of illness on family members, measured with a rating scale, varies by relationship type for certain illnesses. Having a child with cancer, a parent with arthritis, or either with depression, is significantly associated with greater spillover, compared with having a spouse with one of these conditions."
3432,Cecilia,YES,NO,"Dobson, Andrew P.",what links bats to emerging infectious diseases?,2005,Science,Sociological Collection,"This article informs that three species of horseshoe bats have now been officially recorded as the natural reservoir host of the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. A key step in determining the threat imposed by new pathogens is identifying the route along which they are transmitted from their reservoir to new hosts such as domestic livestock or humans. In the case of pathogens that use bats as reservoirs, a common route seems likely. Bats' feeding habits are constrained by the aerodynamics of flight, so they can not ingest huge amounts of food. Yet many bats are frugivorous, that is, they meet their energy requirements by ingesting fruits. The animal pens of the pig farms where the Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia was first reported were littered with partially digested fruits that were regurgitated from bats. Similar observations were reported at the site of the Hendra virus outbreak in Queensland, Australia. In Bangladesh, the Nipah virus has been shown to be transmitted directly from bats to humans. There, during the fruiting season, young boys climb trees to pick fruit."

In order to understand this finding prior to sufficient data availability, we chose to examine critically currently accepted but troublesome 'Lyme disease' concepts. Our method was to analyze each foundation 'Lyme disease' premise within the context of available medical and veterinary literature, then to reconstruct the disease model consistent with the preponderance of that data. We find the present conceptualization of the illness seriously truncated, with a high likelihood of two distinct but connected forms of human B. burgdorferi infection. The yet-unrecognized form appears to have a broader clinical presentation, wider geographic distribution, and vastly greater prevalence. We conclude that 'Lyme disease' currently acknowledges only its zoonosis arm and is a limited conceptualization of a far more pervasive and unrecognized infection state that must be considered a global epidemic.

Clinical signs of leptospirosis in dogs relate to development of renal disease, hepatic disease, uveitis, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Disease may follow periods of high rainfall, and can occur in dogs roaming in proximity to water sources, farm animals, or wildlife, or dogs residing in suburban environments. Diagnosis is based on acute and convalescent phase antibody titers by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), with or without use of polymerase chain reaction assays. There is considerable interlaboratory variation in MAT results, and the MAT does not accurately predict the infecting serogroup. The recommended treatment for optimal clearance of the organism from renal tubules is doxycycline, 5 mg/kg PO q12h, for 14 days. Annual vaccination can prevent leptospirosis caused by serovars included in the vaccine and is recommended for dogs at risk of infection."

The +Redivi network measures the burden of imported infections in Spain and is essential for closing the gap in travel medicine. Methods: Demographic characteristics, travel information, syndromes and confirmed travel-related diagnoses were registered in a standardised online database. Results: A total of 10 767 cases of imported infectious diseases were registered between October 2009 and December 2015. Of these, 60.8% of cases were immigrants seen for the first time after arrival, 20.6% were travellers, and 18.4% were individuals visiting friends and relatives (VFR [immigrants and travellers]). The median time between arrival and medical consultation was 5.5 years for immigrants, 2.0 weeks for travellers, 3.1 weeks for VFR-travellers and 11.4 for VFR-immigrants. The most prevalent diagnoses were Chagas disease in immigrants and nonspecific acute diarrhoea in travellers. Malaria by P. falciparum was one of the most prevalent diagnoses among VFR. More than half the travellers saw a physician before travelling, although one-third of those for whom antimalarial medication was indicated did not take their medication correctly. As for VFR, only 10.4% of VFR-immigrants and 32.5% of VFR-travellers sought pre-travel advice. Only 23 and 21%, respectively, of those for whom antimalarial prophylaxis was indicated took the medication properly. Conclusions: +Redivi provides a clear picture of the prevalence of imported infectious diseases among travellers and immigrants in Spain. The data collected could be used to improve everyday health care provided to travellers and immigrants after travel, to guide pre-travel consultations and to monitor the potential occurrence of tropical or exotic infectious diseases."

Co-chaired by Professors Heinz Feldmann and Jurgen Richt, the conference explored 10 topics: (i) The ecology of emerging zoonotic diseases; (ii) The role of wildlife in emerging zoonoses; (iii) Cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens; (iv) Emerging and neglected influenza viruses; (v) Haemorrhagic fever viruses; (vi) Emerging bacterial diseases; (vii) Outbreak responses to zoonotic diseases; (viii) Food-borne zoonotic diseases; (ix) Prion diseases; and (x) Modelling and prediction of emergence of zoonoses. Human medicine, veterinary medicine and environmental challenges are viewed as a unity, which must be considered under the umbrella of One Health. Several presentations attempted to integrate the insights gained from field data with mathematical models in the search for effective control measures of specific zoonoses. The overriding objective of the research presentations was to create, improve and use the tools essential to address the risk of contagions in a globalized society. In seeking to fulfil this objective, a three-step approach has often been applied: (i) use cultured cells, model and natural animal hosts and human clinical models to study infection; (ii) combine traditional histopathological and biochemical approaches with functional genomics, proteomics and computational biology; and (iii) obtain signatures of virulence and insights into mechanisms of host defense response, immune evasion and pathogenesis.

Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu, and swine flu posing pandemic threats have compelled health agencies to follow global preparedness for combating the emerging deadly pathogens. The outbreak in West Africa of highly contagious Ebola viral disease (EVD) that started in Guinea in December 2013, assumed global proportions to become the largest outbreak of EVD and the most prominent international health concern. With fatality rates of nearly 50%-90%, it has claimed, as of 11 April 2015, 10,619 human lives out of a total of 25,626 cases reported worldwide. Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of Filoviridae family, is associated with severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and animals. The animal hosts, including non-human primates and reservoir hosts (fruit bats), play a significant role in transmission and maintenance of EBOV in nature. Although no approved vaccine for the prevention of EVD currently exists, disease control can be greatly enhanced by timely laboratory confirmation through blood tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adherence to strict sanitary and hygienic measures, monitoring and surveillance of EBOV, as well as quarantine checks on international trade, transport, and visitors from affected countries are mandatory to prevent and control the spread of EVD. This review describes the salient properties of EBOV and the development of novel diagnostics, vaccines, and control strategies for this emerging disease of high public health concern and international emergency."

Models were run with @Risk software using Monte Carlo simulations. The mean number of cells of Campylobacter ingested per Ontarian per day during the summer, ranked from highest to lowest is as follows: household pets, chicken, living on a farm, raw milk, visiting a farm, recreational water, beef, drinking water, pork, vegetables, seafood, petting zoos, and fruits. The study results identify knowledge gaps for some transmission routes, and indicate that some transmission routes for Campylobacter are underestimated in the current literature, such as household pets and raw milk.

This review summarizes yet another new role of Ran - control of the activity of NF-kappaB in host immune responses. Overexpression of a specific allele of Ran results in preferential accumulation of nuclear RanGTP, downmodulation of proinflammatroy cytokine production and protection against septic shock. Nuclear RanGTP interacts with Exportin1, which in turn binds to IkappaB. Nuclear IkappaB binds to NF-kappaB in the nucleus, inhibiting NF-kappaB transcriptional activation of proinflammatory cytokine genes. Nuclear IkB also functions as an adaptor between NF-kappaB and Exportin1/RanGTP, enhancing export of NF-kappaB to the cytoplasm and further reducing the magnitude of host immune responses. From this picture, it appears that modulation of host immune responses via RanGTPase will have an immense impact on a wide spectrum of emerging infectious diseases, cancer and other genetic diseases."

We summarise case studies of diseases that have affected wildlife to the point of extinction and bring together the experiences of wildlife managers, veterinarians, epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, zoologists and ecologists to provide an investigation framework to help ecologists and wildlife managers address disease as a factor in wildlife declines. Catastrophic declines of wildlife may be the result of single or multiple synergistic causes, and disease should always be one factor under consideration, unless proven otherwise.

Location Global. Methods This paper reviews and synthesizes literature that focuses on phylogenetic analyses and reciprocal mapping of a model system of hosts and their parasites to determine patterns of host-parasite associations and geographical distributions through time. Results Host-switching and geographical dispersal of parasites are common phenomena, occurring on many temporal and spatial scales. Diversification involving both co-evolution and colonization explains complex host-parasite associations. Across the expanse of Earth history, the major radiations in host-parasite assemblages have been preceded by ecological disruption, ecological breakdown and host-switching in a context that can be defined by the concept of ecological fitting. This cyclical process sets the stage for co-diversification during periods of relative stability, punctuated by host-switching during episodes of regional to global environmental disruption and climatological change. Main conclusions Most observed host-parasite associations can be explained by an historical interaction between ecological fitting, oscillation (episodes of increasing host range alternating with isolation on particular hosts) and taxon pulses (cyclical episodes of expansion and isolation in geographical range). Major episodes of environmental change appear to be the main drivers for both the persistence and diversification of host-parasite systems, creating opportunities for host-switching during periods of geographical expansion and allowing for co-evolution and co-speciation during periods of geographical isolation."

We reviewed 117 field estimates of parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds, showing that there was significant consistency in mortality among host and parasite taxa. Virulence increased towards the tropics in analyses of both species-specific data and phylogenetic analyses. We found evidence of greater parasite prevalence being associated with reduced virulence. Furthermore, bird species breeding in open nest sites suffered from greater parasite-induced mortality than hole-nesting species. By contrast, parasite specialization and generation time of parasites relative to that of hosts explained little variation in virulence. Likewise, there were little or no significant effects of host genetic variability, host sociality, host migration, host insular distribution or host survival on parasite virulence. These findings suggest that parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds is mainly determined by geographical location and to a smaller extent nest site and prevalence."

Bunyaviridae family of viruses comprises a large group of animal viruses. Clinical symptoms exhibited by persons infected by viruses belonging to this family vary from mild-to-severe diseases i. e., febrile illness, encephalitis, haemorrhagic fever and acute respiratory illness. Several arthropods-borne viruses have been discovered and classified at serological level in India in the past. Some of these are highly pathogenic as the recent emergence and spread of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and presence of antibodies against Hantavirus in humans in India have provided evidences that it may become one of the emerging diseases in this country. For many of the discovered viruses, we still need to study their relevance to human and animal health. Chittoor virus, a variant of Batai virus; Ganjam virus, an Asian variant of Nairobi sheep disease virus; tick-borne viruses such as Bhanja, Palma and mosquito-borne viruses such as Sathuperi, Thimiri, Umbre and Ingwavuma viruses have been identified as the members of this family. As Bunyaviruses are three segmented RNA viruses, they can reassort the segments into genetically distinct viruses in target cells. This ability is believed to play a major role in evolution, pathogenesis and epidemiology of the viruses.

Risks and benefits were quantified per patient assuming a mean of 6 AP units per treatment cycle and using available clinical data, mathematical modeling, and observational studies. Current risks associated with AP transfusion can be divided into known partially addressed risks, known well-addressed risks, and unknown risks associated with acute or chronic emerging infectious agents (EIAs). Bacterial contamination dominates the first category, at a per-patient rate of 1:250, which correlates with an estimated septic transfusion reaction rate of 1:1000. Quantitation of per-patient EIA risk was modeled to be between 1:370 (acute) and 1:667 (chronic). Due to its broad range of action PI is expected to reduce or eliminate these infectious risks and also to reduce the rate of febrile transfusion reactions and possibly alloimmunization. These benefits are weighed against 1) concerns for excess bleeding, 2) an apparent increase in acute respiratory distress syndrome in the initial report of the SPRINT clinical trial, and 3) the possible toxicity associated with the introduction of a new chemical into platelet (PLT) units. However, transfusion of an estimated 100,000 patients with PI PLTs worldwide has occurred without reported serious adverse effects. We conclude that evidence indicates a favorable risk-benefit profile for the implementation of PLT PI and argues for a path forward toward US regulatory approval."

The objective of this paper is to assess the research status of leptospirosis in Colombia in order to identify trends, knowledge gaps, and directions for future research. Methodology: With the aim of gathering all the information available on leptospirosis in the country, a web search was conducted in various indexes and databases. The search terms used were: Leptospirosis + Colombia. A total of 95 publications were found and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The first report of leptospirosis in the country was published in 1957. More than 60% of the published works focus on the prevalence of the disease. The Central part of the country is the area with the highest number of publications. MAT was used in 84% of the prevalence studies and humans are the most studied taxonomic group, with 45% of the publications. The highest prevalence of the disease was registered for rodents (82.7%, 62/75), followed by humans (67.9%, 53/78), pigs (67.6%, 342/506), and dogs (67.2%, 41/61). The prevalence of the disease in the country is associated with occupational factors, hygiene conditions and contact with rodents. Conclusion: Although leptospirosis is a prevalent disease in Colombia, the limitations of the diagnostic techniques used and the lack of a unified criteria on titers thresholds, make an accurate assessment of the prevalence of the disease in the country problematic."

Method: A chart review study was conducted in 2014. Data were abstracted from medical charts of adults (>= 18 years) with a fever (>= 38 degrees C), who were hospitalized (for >= 24 h) in 2010-2012. Results: Of the 600 patients whose charts were analyzed, 76 % were from Yerevan and 51 % were male; the mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 35.5 (+/- 16) years. Livestock exposure was recorded in 5 % of charts. Consumption of undercooked meat and unpasteurized dairy products were reported in 11 and 8 % of charts, respectively. Intestinal infections (51 %) were the most frequently reported final medical diagnoses, followed by diseases of the respiratory system (11 %), infectious mononucleosis (9.5 %), chickenpox (8.3 %), brucellosis (8.3 %), viral hepatitis (3.2 %), and erysipelas (1.5 %). Reviewed medical charts included two cases of fever of unknown origin (FUO), two cutaneous anthrax cases, two leptospirosis cases, three imported malaria cases, one case of rickettsiosis, and one case of rabies. Engagement in agricultural activities, exposure to animals, consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk, and male gender were significantly associated with brucellosis. Conclusion: Our analysis indicated that brucellosis was the most frequently reported zoonotic disease among hospitalized febrile patients. Overall, these study results suggest that zoonotic and arboviral infections were not common etiologies among febrile adult patients admitted to the Nork Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital in Armenia."

Current knowledge suggests that FP is an emerging infectious disease, with the prevalence varying both spatially and temporally, even between localities in close proximity to each other. A high prevalence of FP in marine turtles has been correlated with residency in areas of reduced water quality, indicating that there is an environmental influence on disease presentation. Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) has been identified as the likely aetiological agent of FR The current taxonomic position of ChHV5 is in the family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphahmesvirinae, genus Scutavirus. Molecular differentiation of strains has revealed that a viral variant is typically present at specific locations, even within sympatric species of marine turtles, indicating that the disease FP originates regionally. There is uncertainty surrounding the exact path of transmission and the conditions that facilitate lesion development, although recent research has identified atypical genes within the genome of ChHV5 that may play a role in pathogenesis. This review discusses emerging areas where researchers might focus and theories behind the emergence of FP globally since the 1980s, which appear to be a multi-factorial interplay between the virus, the host and environmental factors influencing disease expression.

The infection is reported in many countries but is most common in eastern Asia. In Thailand, a southeast Asian country, the infection is sporadic. Design: In this study the clinical presentations of human sparganosis cases in Thailand were investigated by means of a literature review. Results: Reports of 34 cases of sparganosis were found. The infections were ocular (17 cases), subcutaneous (ten cases), central nervous system (five cases), auricular (one case), pulmonary (one case), intraosseous (one case) and intraperitoneal, (one case). Of these 34 cases, 14 had risk behaviour reported, 12 had a history of drinking impure water, five had a history of eating frog or snake meat and two had a history of using frog or snake meat as a poultice. Some cases had more than one risk factor. Conclusion: Most cases of sparganosis in Thailand presented with superficial ocular mass lesions. The major risk behaviour in Thailand is drinking water contaminated with the infective organism. Some cases of serious deep visceral. sparganosis have also been reported.

PPE is a critical component in the hierarchy of controls used to protect HCWs from infectious hazards. HCW PPE may include gowns, respirators, face masks, gloves, eye protection, face shields, and head and shoe coverings. Important research has been conducted in certain areas, such as respirators and protective masks, but studies in other areas, particularly gowns, are scarce. Gowns are identified as the second-most-used piece of PPE, following gloves, in the healthcare setting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guideline for Isolation Precautions, isolation gowns should be worn to protect HCWs' arms and exposed body areas during procedures and patient-care activities when anticipating contact with clothing, blood, bodily fluids, secretions and excretions. Isolation gowns currently available on the marketplace offer varying resistance to blood and other bodily fluids depending on the type of the material, its impermeability, and wear and tear. While some studies show no benefit of the routine use of isolation gowns, others demonstrate that its use is associated with a reduced infection rate. This paper reviews isolation gowns in healthcare settings, including the fabrics used, gown design and interfaces, as well as critical parameters that affect microorganism and liquid transmission through fabrics."

Approximately 350 million people are at risk of contracting the disease and an estimated 1.6 million new cases occur annually. Of the two main forms, visceral and cutaneous, the visceral form is fatal in 85-90% of untreated cases. Aims: This literature review aims to identify and evaluate the current evidence base for the use of various preventative methods against human leishmaniasis. Methods: A literature search was performed of the relevant database repositories for primary research conforming to a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: A total of 84 controlled studies investigating 12 outcome measures were identified, implementing four broad categories of preventative interventions: animal reservoir control, vector population control, human reservoir control and a category for multiple concurrently implemented interventions. The primary studies investigated a heterogeneous mix of outcome measures using a range of different methods. Conclusions: This review highlights an absence of research measuring human-specific outcomes (35% of the total) across all intervention categories. The apparent inability of study findings to be generalizable across different geographic locations, points towards gaps in knowledge regarding the biology of transmission of Leishmania in different settings. More research is needed which investigates human infection as the primary outcome measure as opposed to intermediate surrogate markers, with a focus on developing a human vaccine."

Their use allows better management of often-finite resources to counter changes in soils that result from essential practices for crop production. Organic amendments provide macro- and micronutrients, including carbon for the restoration of soil physical and chemical properties. Challenges from the use of organic amendments arise from the presence of heavy metals and the inability to control the transformations required to convert the organic forms of N and P into the minerals available to crops, and particularly to minimize the losses of these nutrients in forms that may present a threat to human health. Animal manure and sewage bio-solids, the organic amendments in greatest abundance, contain components that can be hazardous to human health, other animals and plants. Pathogens pose an immediate threat. Antibiotics, other pharmaceuticals and naturally produced hormones may pose a threat if they increase the number of zoonotic disease organisms that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs or interfere with reproductive processes. Some approaches aimed at limiting N losses (e.g. covered liquid or slurry storage, rapid incorporation into the soil, timing applications to minimize delay before plant uptake) also tend to favor survival of pathogens. Risks to human health, through the food chain and drinking water, from the pathogens, antibiotics and hormonal substances that may be present in organic amendments can be reduced by treatment before land application, such as in the case of sewage biosolids. Other sources, such as livestock and poultry manures, are largely managed by ensuring that they are applied at the rate, time and place most appropriate to the crops and soils. A more holistic approach to management is required as intensification of agriculture increases."

It is now appreciated that viruses are the most common cause of diarrhoeal illness worldwide. Although bacteria and other pathogens cause significant numbers of gastroenteritis, it is the viruses that are dealt with in this review. The viruses responsible will be discussed individually. Recent findings Rotavirus remains the leading cause of diarrhoeal disease overall, with the newly designated calicivirus family causing the most outbreaks in the industrialized nations. As diagnostic techniques improve, however, the importance of astrovirus and other previously under-reported pathogens is becoming more apparent and the number of viruses associated with gastroenteritis continues to increase. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, arguably the most important emerging infection of recent years and a cause of significant gastrointestinal disease, is also discussed.

Since then it has spread very rapidly to several European countries. The disease is characterised by fever, reduced milk production and diarrhoea in cattle and abortions, stillbirths and foetal abnormalities in sheep and goats. SBV is an enveloped, negative-sense, segmented, single-stranded RNA virus, classified in the genus Orthobunyavirus of the Bunyaviridae family, and is closely related to Akabane, Ainoa and Shamonda viruses. As of now there is no vaccine available for SBV, which poses a serious threat to naive ruminant population.

Landscape epidemiology, which connects disease ecology and landscape ecology, is still an emerging field. We argue that landscape epidemiology must move beyond simply studying the influence of landscape configuration and composition on epidemiological processes and towards a more comparative, systems approach that better incorporates social-ecological complexity. We illustrate our argument with a detailed review, based on a single conceptual systems model, of geographic variation in drivers of avian influenza in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and Southern Africa. Our three study regions are similar in some ways but quite different in others. The same underlying mechanisms apply in all cases, but differences in the attributes of key components and linkages (most notably avian diversity, the abiotic environment, land use and land cover, and food production systems) create significant differences in avian influenza virus prevalence and human risk between regions. Landscape approaches can connect local- and continental-scale elements of epidemiology. Adopting a landscape-focused systems perspective on the problem facilitates the identification of the most important commonalities and differences, guiding both science and policy, and helps to identify elements of the problem on which further research is needed. More generally, our review demonstrates the importance of social-ecological interactions and comparative approaches for landscape epidemiology."

For each disease/infection, three additional materials develop examples already published, specifying the epidemiological role of the species as assigned by the authors. Furthermore, risk factors associated with interactions between wild and domestic animals and regarding emerging infectious diseases are summarized. Finally, the wildlife surveillance measures implemented in different European countries are presented. New research areas are proposed in order to provide efficient tools to prevent the transmission of diseases between wild ungulates and livestock."

Despite the recent proliferation of many efficient virus discovery methods, careful selection of a combination of methods is important to demonstrate a novel virus, its clinical associations, and its relevance in a timely manner. The identification of a patient or an outbreak with distinctive clinical features and negative routine microbiological workup is often the starting point for virus hunting. This review appraises the rotes of culture, electron microscopy, and nucleic acid detection based methods in optimizing virus discovery. Cell culture is generally slow but may yield viable virus. Although the choice of cell Line often involves trial and error, it may be guided by the clinical syndrome. Electron microscopy is insensitive but fast, and may provide morphological clues to choice of cell Line or consensus primers for nucleic acid detection. Consensus primer PCR can be used to detect viruses that are closely related to known virus families. Random primer amplification and high-throughput sequencing can catch any virus genome but cannot yield an infectious virion for testing Koch postulates. A systematic approach that incorporates carefully chosen combinations of virus detection techniques is required for successful virus discovery."

Research has typically focussed on the prevalence, concentration, and transmission of zoonoses from farm animals to humans, yet there are gaps in our understanding of these factors among animals in contact with the public who don't live on or visit farms. This study aims to quantify, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the prevalence and concentration of Campylobacter carriage in household pets and petting zoo animals. Four databases were accessed for the systematic review (PubMed, CAB direct, ProQuest, and Web of Science) for papers published in English from 1992-2012, and studies were included if they examined the animal population of interest, assessed prevalence or concentration with fecal, hair coat, oral, or urine exposure routes (although only articles that examined fecal routes were found), and if the research was based in Canada, USA, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Studies were reviewed for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis by two reviewers, compiled into a database, and relevant studies were used to create a weighted mean prevalence value. There were insufficient data to run a meta-analysis of concentration values, a noted study limitation. The mean prevalence of Campylobacter in petting zoo animals is 6.5% based on 7 studies, and in household pets the mean is 24.7% based on 34 studies. Our estimated concentration values were: 7.65x10(3)cfu/g for petting zoo animals, and 2.9x10(5)cfu/g for household pets. These results indicate that Campylobacter prevalence and concentration are lower in petting zoo animals compared with household pets and that both of these animal sources have a lower prevalence compared with farm animals that do not come into contact with the public. There is a lack of studies on Campylobacter in petting zoos and/or fair animals in Canada and abroad. Within this literature, knowledge gaps were identified, and include: a lack of concentration data reported in the literature for Campylobacter spp. in animal feces, a distinction between ill and diarrheic pets in the reported studies, noted differences in shedding and concentrations for various subtypes of Campylobacter, and consistent reporting between studies."

The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a systematic review of published cases of marine mammal disease to determine spatial and temporal trends in disease from 1972-2012, including changes in regions and taxa affected and specific causes; and 2) compare numbers of published cases of neoplasia with known, hospital-based neoplasia records to explore the causes of discrepancy between numbers of published cases and true disease trends. Peer-reviewed literature was compiled, and data were collected from The Marine Mammal Center database in Sausalito, California for comparison of numbers of neoplasia cases. Toxicoses from harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. Viral epidemics are most common along the Atlantic U.S. coastline, while bacterial epidemics, especially leptospirosis, are most common along the Pacific coast. Certain protozoal and fungal zoonoses appear to be emerging, such as Toxoplasma gondii in southern sea otters in California, and Cryptococcus gattii in cetaceans in the Pacific Northwest. Disease reports were most common from California where pinniped populations are large, but increased effort also occurs. Anthropogenic trauma remains a large threat to marine mammal health, through direct mortality and indirect chronic disease. Neoplasia cases were under-reported from 2003-2012 when compared to true number of cases, and over-reported in several years due to case duplication. Peer-reviewed literature greatly underestimates the true magnitude of disease in marine mammals as it focuses on novel findings, fails to reflect etiology of multifactorial diseases, rarely reports prevalence rather than simple numbers of cases, and is typically presented years after a disease first occurs. Thus literature cannot guide management actions adequately, nor inform indices of ocean health. A real-time, nationally centralized system for reporting marine mammal disease data is needed to be able to understand how marine mammal diseases are changing with ecosystem changes, and before these animals can truly be considered 'sentinels of ocean health'."

We conducted a systematic review, to compare methods and outputs of published phenomenological and mechanistic modelling studies pertaining to the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemics in four West African countries - Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. We searched Pubmed, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant English language publications up to December 2015. Of the 874 articles identified, 41 met our inclusion criteria. We evaluated these selected studies based on: the sources of the case data used, and modelling approaches, compartments used, population mixing assumptions, model fitting and calibration approaches, sensitivity analysis used and data bias considerations. We synthesised results of the estimated epidemiological parameters: basic reproductive number (R-0), serial interval, latent period, infectious period and case fatality rate, and examined their relationships. The median of the estimated mean R-0 values were between 1 center dot 30 and 1 center dot 84 in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Much higher R-0 value of 9 center dot 01 was described for Nigeria. We investigated several issues with uncertainty around EVD modes of transmission, and unknown observation biases from early reported case data. We found that epidemic models offered R-0 mean estimates which are country-specific, but these estimates are not associating with the use of several key disease parameters within the plausible ranges. We find simple models generally yielded similar estimates of R-0 compared with more complex models. Models that accounted for data uncertainty issues have offered a higher case forecast compared with actual case observation. Simple model which offers transparency to public health policy makers could play a critical role for advising rapid policy decisions under an epidemic emergency."

Ecological assembly, sometimes referred to as greening, following abandonment can yield valuable ecosystem services, but also can pose a risk to public health. Abandonment can elevate zoonotic vector-borne disease risk by favoring the hyperabundance of commensal pests and pathogen vectors. Though greater biodiversity in abandoned areas can potentially dilute vector-borne pathogen transmission, greening can elevate transmission risk by increasing movement of pathogen vectors between fragmented areas and by giving rise to novel human-wildlife interfaces. Idled and derelict infrastructure can further elevate disease risk from vector-borne and water-borne pathogens, which can build up in stagnant and unprotected water that maintenance and routine use of delivery or sanitation systems would otherwise eliminate. Thus, framing greening as inherently positive could result in policies and actions that unintentionally exacerbate inequalities by elevating risks rather than delivering benefits. As counter-urbanism is neither a minor pattern of urban development, nor a short-term departure from urban growth, homeowner and municipal management of abandoned areas should account for potential hazards to reduce health risks. Further socioecological assessments of public health risks following abandonment could better ensure the resilience and well-being of communities in shrinking cities."

This infectious disease known with a high incidence in Reunion island (French overseas territories in Indian Ocean) is in state of endemia especially during rains season. Objectives. - The aim of our work was to identify the mains epidemiologic, clinical, biological, and therapeutic features of leptospirosis in children. Population and methods. - We conducted a retrospective analysis of children hospitalized in pediatric unit with the diagnosis of leptospirosis from January 2001 to June 2004 in general hospital of Saint-Denis. We found out 16 cases (mean age 14 years, range 9-17), mainly boys (ratio 7:1). Results. - The patient sera reacted most strongly with Leptospira interrogans serovars canicola (66%), icterohaemorrhagiae (17%), and sejroe (17%). Epidemiologic data indicated contact with contaminated water in most cases (68%). Jaundice was present in 43% of the patients, increased transaminase levels in 56%, renal failure in 50%, meningitis in 25%, ECG abnormalities in 6%, respiratory manifestations in 6%, systemic manifestations in 12% and thrombocytopenia in 56%. Death rate was zero, but renal failure is likely to induce life prognosis. Discussion. - The diagnosis' traps are numerous, leading to an underestimation and underdiagnosis of the leptospirosis, more over there is a lack in specific, reliable, and quick biological test to make the diagnosis. A negative polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR) do not exclude the diagnosis, and the microagglutination test (MAT) remains the reference of the undoubtly diagnosis of leptospirosis. It appears that it is more often the conjunction of epidemiologic data (young boy, swimming or fishing in river, rains season), with clinical and biological data that lead to the diagnosis. Diagnosis was not evoked at the emergency room in 37% of the patients. Conclusion. - Leptospirosis should be considered face to an influenza like illness especially during rains season.

This article describes infection control measures developed to strengthen the hospital's capacity to safely diagnose and treat patients with EVD. After admission of the first patient with EVD, a multidisciplinary team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) joined the hospital's infection preventionists to implement a system of occupational safety and health controls for direct patient care, handling of clinical specimens, and managing regulated medical waste. Existing engineering and administrative controls were strengthened. The personal protective equipment (PPE) ensemble was standardized, HCP were trained on donning and doffing PPE, and a system of trained observers supervising PPE donning and doffing was implemented. Caring for patients with EVD placed substantial demands on a community hospital. The experiences of the authors and others informed national policies for the care of patients with EVD and protection of HCP, including new guidance for PPE, a rapid system for deploying CDC staff to assist hospitals (""Ebola Response Team""), and a framework for a tiered approach to hospital preparedness. The designation of regional Ebola treatment centers and the establishment of the National Ebola Training and Education Center address the need for HCP to be prepared to safely care for patients with EVD and other high-consequence emerging infectious diseases."

The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache and dyspnoea. Respiratory failure is the major complication of SARS and similar to 20% of patients may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support. However, the severity is much milder in infected young children. Treatment of SARS was empirical in 2003 due to our limited understanding of this new disease. Protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) in combination with ribavirin may play a role as antiviral therapy in the early phase, whereas the role of IFN and systemic steroid in preventing immune-mediated lung injury deserves further investigation. Knowledge of the genomic sequence of the SARS coronavirus has facilitated the development of rapid diagnostic tests. In addition, other antiviral treatment, RNA interference, monoclonal antibody, synthetic peptides, and vaccines are being developed.

The main sources of swine infectious diseases include the so-called primary sources (direct infection, i.e. through contact with infected and sick animals) and secondary sources (contaminated meat products, slaughter products, and vectors, including ticks). At present, the most serious epidemiological and economic threat to swine breeding in Europe is African swine fever (ASF). This disease, originally coming from Africa, is incurable and causes death of infected pigs and wild boars during 7-10 days after infection. Among the various factors that influence the spread of ASF, important role is played by ticks from the genus Ornithodoros, mainly from the species Ornithodoros moubata. Research on the ASF indicates that other species of ticks can also transmit the virus to healthy pigs in laboratory conditions. Sylvatic and domestic cycles of ASF virus transmission, which have been described so far, require further studies and updating in order to point the potential new vectors in the Caucasus and Eastern Europe affected by the ASF. Effective methods of control and biosecurity may significantly slow down the spread of ASF, which undoubtedly is a major threat to world pig production and international swine trade."

This interest is in part driven by an impression that the threat is increasing, but there has been little analysis of the changing rates of biosecurity threat, and existing evidence is equivocal. Traditional biosecurity systems for animals and plants differ substantially but are beginning to converge. Bio-economic modelling of risk will be a valuable tool in guiding the allocation of limited resources for biosecurity. The future of prevention and management systems will be strongly influenced by new technology and the growing role of the private sector. Overall, today's biosecurity systems are challenged by changing national priorities regarding trade, by new concerns about environmental effects of biological invasions and by the question 'who pays?'. Tomorrow's systems may need to be quite different to be effective. We suggest three changes: an integration of plant and animal biosecurity around a common, proactive, risk-based approach; a greater focus on international cooperation to deal with threats at source; and a commitment to refocus biosecurity on building resilience to invasion into agroecosystems rather than building walls around them."

Today, dengue is considered one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases in humans in terms of morbidity and mortality. Globally, it is estimated that approximate 50 to 100 million new dengue virus infections occur annually. Among these, there are 200,000 to 500,000 cases of potential life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and increased vascular permeability. The death rate associated with the more severe form DHF/DSS is approximately 5%, predominantly in children under the age of 15. Although intensive efforts have been made to study the early clinical pathophysiology of dengue infection with the objective to identify the potential cause of DHF, results or data that have accumulated from different regions of the world involving studies of different ethnicity groups are inconsistent at present in terms of identifying a unified hypothesis for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Thus, the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS remain elusive. The purpose of this review is to identify alternate factors, such as innate immune parameters, hyper-thermal factors, conditioning of neutralizing antibody, concept of vector transmission, and physical status of virus in viremic patients that may play a role in the induction of DHF and DSS, which might have directly or indirectly contributed to the discrepancies that are noted in the literature reported to date. It is the hope that identification of an alternative explanation for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS will pave the way for the institution of new strategies for the prevention of this complicated disease."

Infectious drivers of these declines include the recently emerged fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Chytridiomycota). The skin disease caused by these fungi is named chytridiomycosis and affects the vital function of amphibian skin. Not all amphibians respond equally to infection and host responses might range from resistant, over tolerant to susceptible. The clinical outcome of infection is highly dependent on the amphibian host, the fungal virulence and environmental determinants. B. dendrobatidis infects the skin of a large range of anurans, urodeles and caecilians, whereas to date the host range of B. salamandrivorans seems limited to urodeles. So far, the epidemic of B. dendrobatidis is mainly limited to Australian, neotropical, South European and West American amphibians, while for B. salamandrivorans it is limited to European salamanders. Other striking differences between both fungi include gross pathology and thermal preferences. With this review we aim to provide the reader with a state-of-the art of host-pathogen interactions for both fungi, in which new data pertaining to the interaction of B. dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans with the host's skin are integrated.

In this critical and quantitative review, we synthesize current knowledge regarding amphibian decline and conservation in the seven countries that constitute Central America. There are 495 currently recognized amphibian species known from the region, distributed among the three extant orders, 16 families, and 69 genera-though description of new species continues to occur at a rapid pace. Central America's amphibian fauna is unique: 251 species are restricted to the region, and amphibian diversity varies among the major biogeographic provinces and climatic zones found in Central America. We use data generated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to evaluate trends in extinction risk among Central American amphibians. As of 2014, there are 207 amphibian species considered threatened by the IUCN, and threat status varies according to taxonomic groupings, biogeographical association, elevation, and life history variables. Major threats to Central American amphibians include both conventional threats (habitat modification, habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, and invasive species) as well as emerging threats that operate on large spatial scales (pollution, emerging infectious diseases, UV-B radiation, and climate change). We conducted a quantitative literature review to document conservation research and to show trends in research activity. While the number of published studies on amphibian conservation increases each year, there are pronounced biogeographic biases in the distribution of published research, and most research is conducted by scientists at institutions outside of Central America with limited involvement of host-nation biologists in amphibian research. We synthesize empirical studies of conservation impacts to amphibians in Central America from habitat modification and fragmentation, overharvesting, invasive species, pollution, UV-B radiation, chytridiomycosis and other amphibian pathogens, climate change, and synergistic interactions among these threats. Much research in the past decade has focused on chytridiomycosis and the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), with far fewer studies on habitat modification, other amphibian pathogens, or climate change impacts to amphibians. We describe ongoing conservation actions for amphibians in the region, including monitoring, protected areas, captive assurance programs, protection of relict populations, reintroductions, and development of in-country capacity for research and conservation programs. We conclude with a list of priorities in research and conservation action for amphibians in the region."

From an early foundation in studies of amphibian natural history sprang generations of scientists who used amphibians as models to address fundamental questions in population and community ecology. More recently, in the wake of an environment that human disturbances rapidly altered, ecologists have adopted amphibians as models for studying applied ecological issues such as habitat loss, pollution, disease, and global climate change. Some of the characteristics of amphibians that make them useful models for studying these environmental problems are highlighted, including their trophic importance, environmental sensitivity, research tractability, and impending extinction. The article provides specific examples from the recent literature to illustrate how studies on amphibians have been instrumental in guiding scientific thought on a broad scale. Included are examples of how amphibian research has transformed scientific disciplines, generated new theories about global health, called into question widely accepted scientific paradigms, and raised awareness in the general public that our daily actions may have widespread repercussions. In addition, studies on amphibian declines have provided insight into the complexity in which multiple independent factors may interact with one another to produce catastrophic and sometimes unpredictable effects. Because of the complexity of these problems, amphibian ecologists have been among the strongest advocates for interdisciplinary research. Future studies of amphibians will be important not only for their conservation but also for the conservation of other species, critical habitats, and entire ecosystems."

Further, it develops a method of ranking each disease in terms of its overall impact, and combines this ranking with published evidence for host genetic variation and information on the current state of genomic tools in each host species. The outcome is an overall ranking of the amenability of each disease to genomic studies that dissect host genetic variation in resistance. Six disease-based assessment criteria were defined: industry concern, economic impact, public concern, threat to food safety or zoonotic potential, impact on animal welfare and threat to international trade barriers. For each category, a subjective score was assigned to each disease according to the relative strength of evidence, impact, concern or threat posed by that particular disease, and the scores were summed across categories. Evidence for host genetic variation in resistance was determined from available published data, including breed comparison, heritability studies, quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies, evidence of candidate genes with significant effects, data on pathogen sequence and on host gene expression analyses. In total, 16 poultry diseases, 13 cattle diseases, nine pig diseases, 11 sheep diseases and three Atlantic salmon diseases were assessed. The top-ranking diseases or pathogens, i.e. those most amenable to studies dissecting host genetic variation, were Salmonella in poultry, bovine mastitis, Marek's disease and coccidiosis, both in poultry. The top-ranking diseases or pathogens in pigs, sheep and Atlantic salmon were Escherichia coli, mastitis and infectious pancreatic necrosis, respectively. These rankings summarise the current state of knowledge for each disease and broadly, although not entirely, reflect current international research efforts. They will alter as more information becomes available and as genome tools become more sophisticated for each species. it is suggested that this approach could be used to rank diseases from other perspectives as well, e.g. in terms of disease control strategies."

A widening of this perspective to include evolutionary considerations has been increasingly developed in response to the rising rates of genetic change in both pathogen populations and tree populations due to human activities. Aims Here, five topics for which the evolutionary perspective is especially relevant are highlighted. Results The first relates to the evolutionary diversity of fungi and fungal-like organisms, with issues linked to the identification of species and their ecological niches. The second theme deals with the evolutionary processes that allow forest pathogens to adapt to new hosts after introductions or to become more virulent in homogeneous plantations. The third theme presents issues linked to disease resistance in tree breeding programs (e.g., growth-defense trade-offs) and proposes new criteria and methods for more durable resistance. The last two themes are dedicated to the biotic environment of the tree-pathogen system, namely, hyperparasites and tree microbiota, as possible solutions for health management. Conclusion We conclude by highlighting three major conceptual advances brought by evolutionary biology, i.e., that (i) ""not everything is everywhere"", (ii) evolution of pathogen populations can occur on short time scales, and (iii) the tree is a multitrophic community.

Public concern and fears are most focused on dogs as the source of rabies infection to humans and other domestic animals. Several bat species are reservoir hosts of rabies and therefore can be a public health hazard. The possibility of a carrier state or asymptomatic form of rabies deserves serious evaluation. Rabies in most countries was successfully controlled through mass vaccination of dogs, long before the recognition of bat and other wildlife rabies and the availability of modern vaccines. Though, the epidemiology, virology, transmission, pathology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and control of rabies infection have been described extensively, the incidence is increasingly on the high side. However, experts have recognized for decades that rabies is wholly eradicable from all species except bats through targeted mass immunization, and the chief obstacle to eradicating rabies especially in bats is that no one has developed an aerosolized vaccine that could be sprayed into otherwise inaccessible caves and tree trunks. Inventing such a vaccine is considered difficult but possible. Forestalling this problem will require active epidemiological surveillance of wild and domestic animals with a wide range of modern molecular and ancillary epidemiological tools. This also demands government and private sector intervention, funding and collaboration of professionals in human and veterinary medicine with those in the environmental sciences. Recently, the heroic recovery of an unvaccinated teenager from clinical rabies offers hope of future specific therapy. While post-exposure vaccination is essential and should be continued with improvement to achieve consistently positive results, progress toward eliminating rabies has been markedly faster in nations that have emphasized preventive vaccination of animals."

Perpetual evolution of viruses is reflected in changing disease patterns, so that familiar viruses are sometimes discovered to cause new or unexpected diseases. For example, canine parvovirus (CPV) has regained the ability to infect felids and cause a panleucopenia-like illness. Feline panleucopenia virus (FPV) has been shown to cause ""fading"" in young kittens and has recently been implicated as a possible cause of feline idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Molecular scrutiny of viral diseases sometimes permits deeper understanding of pathogenesis and epizootiology, Feline gastrointestinal lymphomas have not, in the past, been strongly associated with retroviral infections, yet some of these tumours harbour retroviral proviruses. Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) may play a role in lymphomagenesis, even in cats diagnosed as uninfected using conventional criteria. There is strong evidence that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) can also be oncogenic. The variant feline coronaviruses that cause invariably-fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) arise by sporadic mutation of an ubiquitous and only mildly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV); a finding that has substantial management implications for cat breeders and veterinarians. Conversely, canine enteric coronavirus (CECV) shows considerable genetic and antigenic diversity but causes only mild, self-limiting diarrhoea in puppies. Routine vaccination against this virus is not recommended. Although parvoviruses, coronaviruses and retroviruses are the most important known viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease, other viruses play a role. Feline and canine rotaviruses have combined with human rotaviruses to produce new, reassortant, zoonotic viruses. Some companion animal rotaviruses can infect humans directly. Undoubtedly, further viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease await discovery."

The final products of those activities usually comprise internal memoranda and briefs within public health authorities and original research published in peer-reviewed journals. Using the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic as an example, we conducted a comprehensive time-stratified review of the published literature to describe the different types of epidemiological outputs. Methods and Findings: We identified and analyzed all published articles on the epidemiology of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong or Toronto. The analysis was stratified by study design, research domain, data collection, and analytical technique. We compared the SARS-case and matched-control non-SARS articles published according to the timeline of submission, acceptance, and publication. The impact factors of the publishing journals were examined according to the time of publication of SARS articles, and the numbers of citations received by SARS-case and matched-control articles submitted during and after the epidemic were compared. Descriptive, analytical, theoretical, and experimental epidemiology concerned, respectively, 54%, 30%, 11%, and 6% of the studies. Only 22% of the studies were submitted, 8% accepted, and 7% published during the epidemic. The submission-to-acceptance and acceptance-to-publication intervals of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic period were significantly shorter than the corresponding intervals of matched-control non-SARS articles published in the same journal issues (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). The differences of median submission-to-acceptance intervals and median acceptance-to-publication intervals between SARS articles and their corresponding control articles were 106.5 d (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.0-140.1) and 63.5 d (95% CI 18.0-94.1), respectively. The median numbers of citations of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic and over the 2 y thereafter were 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 8.0-52.0) and 8 (IQR 3.2-21.8), respectively, significantly higher than the median numbers of control article citations (15, IQR 8.5-16.5, p<0.05, and 7, IQR 3.0-12.0, p<0.01, respectively). Conclusions: A majority of the epidemiological articles on SARS were submitted after the epidemic had ended, although the corresponding studies had relevance to public health authorities during the epidemic. To minimize the lag between research and the exigency of public health practice in the future, researchers should consider adopting common, predefined protocols and ready-to-use instruments to improve timeliness, and thus, relevance, in addition to standardizing comparability across studies. To facilitate information dissemination, journal managers should reengineer their fast-track channels, which should be adapted to the purpose of an emerging outbreak, taking into account the requirement of high standards of quality for scientific journals and competition with other online resources."

The members of Herpesviridae are host specific agents that also share many properties that potentially make them capable of crossing the species barriers. The objective of presented review paper was to summarize the relationship between herpesviruses of animals and humans and their zoonotic potential. In humans, the most epidemiologically important herpesviruses are represented by Human herepesvirus-1 and Human herpesvirus-2, which are commonly known as herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, varicella-zooster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as Human herpesviruses: HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7. However, in terms of the potential to cross the species barrier, there are a few herpesviruses, including B virus disease (CeHV-1), Marek's disease virus (MDV), Equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) or pseudorabies virus (PRV), which are potentially able to infect different hosts. To summarize, in advantageous conditions the host specific herpesviruses may pose a threat for public health but also may exert a negative impact on the economical aspects of animal production. The most probable of these are zoonotic infections caused by B virus disease; however, close contact between infected animal hosts and humans may lead to transmission and replication of other Herpesviridoe members."

Although AH as a disease concept is neither represented in the DSM-5 nor the ICD-10, it may be classified as a subform of the hoarding disorder (DSM-5 300.3) that was implemented in the DSM-5 as an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Due to the hygienic deficiencies of the living spaces and the insufficient keeping of animals there is an increased risk of epizootic diseases and zoonoses. Specific epidemiological studies do not exist, however, women seem to be affected more frequently. AH is diagnosed mostly in late adulthood. Besides thorough somatic and psychiatric medical diagnostics, cooperation with the veterinary offices and authorities is usually necessary. Comorbid mental disorders (particularly depressive, obsessive-compulsive and personality disorders) are frequent. Currently, no evidence-based therapies exist.

The clinical effects of infection vary with the exposure history, age and immune status of the host, and also the virulence of the influenza strain. In humans, the virus is transmitted through either aerosol or contact-based transfer of infectious respiratory secretions. As is evidenced by most zoonotic influenza virus infections, not all strains that can infect humans are able to transmit from person-to-person. Animal models of influenza are essential to research efforts aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to the disease and transmission outcomes of influenza virus infection in humans. These models furthermore allow the pre-clinical testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality in the population through amelioration of the virulence or transmissibility of influenza viruses. Mice, ferrets, guinea pigs, cotton rats, hamsters and macaques have all been used to study influenza viruses and therapeutics targeting them. Each model presents unique advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed herein."

The virus remained confined to the equatorial regions of Africa and Asia, cycling between infecting monkeys, arboreal mosquitoes, and occasionally humans. The ZIKV Asiatic strain was probably introduced into Brazil in or around late 2013. Presently, ZIKV is in contact with the rich biodiversity in all Brazilian biomes, bordering on other Latin American countries. Infections in Brazilian primates have been reported recently, but the overall impact of this virus on wildlife in the Americas is still unknown. The current epidemic in the Americas requires knowledge on the role of mammals, especially nonhuman primates (NHPs), in ZIKV transmission to humans. The article discusses the available data on ZIKV in host animals and issues of biodiversity, rapid environmental change, and impact on human health in megadiverse Latin American countries. The authors reviewed scientific articles and recent news stories on ZIKV in animals, showing that 47 animal species from three orders (mammals, reptiles, and birds) have been investigated for the potential to establish a sylvatic cycle. The review aims to contribute to epidemiological studies and the knowledge on the natural history of ZIKV. The article concludes with questions that require urgent attention in epidemiological studies involving wildlife in order to understand their role as ZIKV hosts and to effectively control the epidemic."

Compared with other well-studied parasitic diseases, fish-borne parasitic zoonoses do not get enough attention, especially because these zoonoses have been limited for the most part to populations living in middle-income countries. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases caused by nematodes result in infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as allergic reactions against parasite antigens. With the globalization of the seafood industry, the risk of humans acquiring anisakiasis in developed countries appears to be underestimated. The risk of infection with Anisakis simplex and related parasites of fish has been recognized for some time, but it is now emerging that indigestion of material from dead parasites in food also present a danger.

Objectives This systematic review assessed the current literature for evidence for or against use of antibiotic prophylaxis against Leptospira infection (leptospirosis). Search strategy The authors searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCI-Expanded as well as relevant professional society meeting abstracts until January 2009. Selection criteria Prospective, randomised clinical trials studying antibiotic prophylaxis against leptospirosis were selected. Data collection and analysis Data collection abstracted participant demographics and outcomes as well as features of trial design and quality. Trial results were analysed to independently determine outcomes, while multiple trial data was pooled when relevant. Main results Three trials were included, all of which evaluated doxycyline use. Trial quality suffered from a lack of intention-to-treat analysis and variability across trials inmethodology and targeted outcomes. One trial assessed post-exposure prophylaxis in an indigenous population after a flood without apparent efficacy in reduction of clinical or laboratory identified Leptospira infection. Two trials assessed pre-exposure prophylaxis, one among deployed soldiers and another in an indigenous population. Despite an odds ratio of 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.36) for laboratory-identified infection among deployed soldiers on doxycyline in one of these two trials, pooled data showed no statistically significant reduction in Leptospira infection among participants (Odds ratio 0.28 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.48). Minor adverse events (predominantly nausea and vomiting) were more common among those on doxycycline with an odds ratio of 11 (95% CI 2.1 to 60). Authors' conclusions Regular use of weekly oral doxycycline 200 mg increases the odds for nausea and vomiting with unclear benefit in reducing Leptospira seroconversion or clinical consequences of infection."

While ELISAs are often used to measure antibody responses to one or several targets, new antibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays, can now evaluate antibody responses to hundreds, or even thousands, of recombinant antigens at one time. These large-scale studies have uncovered new antigenic targets, provided new insights into vaccine research and yielded an overview of immunoreactivity against almost the entire proteome of certain pathogens. However, solid-phase antigen arrays also have drawbacks that limit the type of information obtained, including suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes, high backgrounds due to impure antigens and a narrow dynamic range of detection. We have developed a solution-phase antibody-profiling technology, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), which harnesses light-emitting recombinant antigen fusion proteins to quantitatively measure patient antibody titers. Owing to the highly linear light output of the luciferase reporter, some antibodies can be detected without serum dilution in a dynamic range of detection often spanning seven orders of magnitude. When LIPS is applied iteratively with multiple target antigens, a high-definition antibody profile is obtained. Here, we discuss the application of these different antibody-profiling technologies and their associated limitations with particular emphasis on protein microarrays. We also describe LIPS in detail and discuss several clinically relevant uses of the technology. Together, these new technologies offer new tools for understanding humoral responses to known and emerging infectious agents."

Clinical manifestations of brucellosis are immune mediated, not due to bacterial virulence factors. Acquired immunity to brucellosis has been studied through observations of naturally infected hosts (cattle, goats), mouse models (mice), and human infection. Even though Brucella spp. are known for producing mechanisms that evade the immune system, cell-mediated immune responses drive the clinical manifestations of human disease after exposure to Brucella species, as high antibody responses are not associated with protective immunity. The precise mechanisms by which cell-mediated immune responses confer protection or lead to disease manifestations remain undefined. Descriptive studies of immune responses in human brucellosis show that TH1 (interferon-gamma-producing T cells) are associated with dominant immune responses, findings consistent with animal studies. Whether these T cell responses are protective, or determine the different clinical responses associated with brucellosis is unknown, especially with regard to undulant fever manifestations, relapsing disease, or are associated with responses to distinct sets of Brucella spp. antigens are unknown. Few data regarding T cell responses in terms of specific recognition of Brucella spp. protein antigens and peptidic epitopes, either by CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, have been identified in human brucellosis patients. Additionally because current attenuated Brucella vaccines used in animals cause human disease, there is a true need for a recombinant protein subunit vaccine for human brucellosis, as well as for improved diagnostics in terms of prognosis and identification of unusual forms of brucellosis. This review will focus on current understandings of antigen-specific immune responses induced Brucella peptidic epitopes that has promise for yielding new insights into vaccine and diagnostics development, and for understanding pathogenetic mechanisms of human brucellosis."

Genetic analysis suggests that B. dendrobatidis is a recently emerged pathogen. This article reviews the biology of this pathogenic chytrid and the evidence for chytridiomycosis as a cause of declines in amphibian populations worldwide. Data are presented to show that antimicrobial peptides, produced in granular glands of the skin and released in high concentrations into skin secretions, are highly effective in inhibiting growth of B. dendrobatidis in vitro and may provide limited protection for some species. Ongoing studies suggest a correlation between resistance to lethal infection by B. dendrobatidis and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by the host amphibian, but further research is needed to define better the role of antimicrobial peptides in protection of amphibian populations and the effect of environmental factors upon antimicrobial peptide synthesis.

Infection with antibiotic resistant bacteria negatively impacts on public health, due to an increased incidence of treatment failure and severity of disease. Development of resistant bacteria in food animals can result from chromosomal mutations but is more commonly associated with the horizontal transfer of resistance determinants borne on mobile genetic elements. Food may represent a dynamic environment for the continuing transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between bacteria. Current food preservation systems that use a combination of environmental stresses to reduce growth of bacteria, may serve to escalate development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance among food related pathogens. The increasing reliance on biocides for pathogen control in food production and processing, heightens the risk of selection of biocide-resistant strains. Of particular concern is the potential for sublethal exposure to biocides to select for bacteria with enhanced multi-drug efflux pump activity capable of providing both resistance to biocides and cross-resistance to multiple antibiotics. Although present evidence suggests that biocide resistance is associated with a physiological cost, the possibility of the development of adaptive mutations conferring increased fitness cannot be ruled-out. Strategies aimed at inhibiting efflux pumps and eliminating plasmids could help to restore therapeutic efficacy to antibiotics and reduce the spread of antibiotic resistant food-borne pathogens through the food chain."

The two predominantly found Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars in the USA and in Europe are S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. Many other nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars have been implicated in foodborne Salmonella outbreaks. Summary reports of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates over time suggest a moderate to low level of antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistance. However, serovar-specific analyses showed in part a steady state, a continuous decline, or a recent increase in resistance to certain antimicrobial agents. Resistance to critically important antimicrobial agents, e.g. third-generation cephalosporins and (fluoro) quinolones is part of many monitoring programmes and the corresponding results confirm that extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are still rarely found in nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars, whereas resistance to (fluoro) quinolones is prevalent at variable frequencies among different serovars from humans and animals in different countries. Although it is likely that nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates from animals represent a reservoir for resistance determinants, it is mostly unknown where and when Salmonella isolates acquired resistance properties and which exchange processes have happened since then.

Amino acid substitutions in viral proteins occasionally cause the emergence of antibody-escape and drug-resistant mutants. With regard to this, we have studied the proteins of several viruses, especially the influenza A virus, by using techniques of computational chemistry and biology such as molecular modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Influenza A virus is a zoonotic pathogen that is transmitted from animals to humans. This virus has two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA of influenza viruses plays a key role in the initiation of viral infection. And HA is also the major target of antibodies that neutralize viral infectivity. Some amino acid substitutions in the antigenic epitope on HA could decrease the interaction between HA and antibodies, leading to the generation of antigenic variants with novel antigenic structures of HA. In addition, HA protein seems to be a favorable target for anti-influenza drugs, but effective HA inhibitors have not been developed due to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses with amino acid substitutions on the HA. To understand how amino acid substitutions affect changes in drug susceptibility, we have been computationally analyzing the three-dimensional structures of influenza virus proteins.

The complex interplay between host, pathogen and environment creates a challenge for conserving species, communities and ecosystem functions, while mediating the many known ecological and socio-economic negative effects of disease. Despite the clear ecological and evolutionary contexts of host-pathogen dynamics, approaches to managing wildlife disease remain predominantly reactionary, focusing on surveillance and some attempts at eradication. A few exceptional studies have heeded recent calls for better integration of ecological concepts in the study and management of wildlife disease; however, evolutionary concepts remain underused. Applied evolution consists of four principles: evolutionary history, genetic and phenotypic variation, selection and eco-evolutionary dynamics. In this article, we first update a classical framework for understanding wildlife disease to integrate better these principles. Within this framework, we explore the evolutionary implications of environment-disease interactions. Subsequently, we synthesize areas where applied evolution can be employed in wildlife disease management. Finally, we discuss some future directions and challenges. Here, we underscore that despite some evolutionary principles currently playing an important role in our understanding of disease in wild animals, considerable opportunities remain for fostering the practice of evolutionarily enlightened wildlife disease management."

Newer species of Arcobacter are being incessantly emerging (presently 25 species have been identified) with novel information on the evolutionary mechanisms and genetic diversity among different Arcobacter species. These have been reported from chickens, domestic animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, horses, dogs), reptiles (lizards, snakes and chelonians), meat (poultry, pork, goat, lamb, beef, rabbit), vegetables and from humans in different countries. Arcobacters are implicated as causative agents of diarrhea, mastitis and abortion in animals, while causing bacteremia, endocarditis, peritonitis, gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans. Three species including A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii are predominantly associated with clinical conditions. Arcobacters are primarily transmitted through contaminated food and water sources. Identification of Arcobacter by biochemical tests is difficult and isolation remains the gold standard method. Current diagnostic advances have provided various molecular methods for efficient detection and differentiation of the Arcobacters at genus and species level. To overcome the emerging antibiotic resistance problem there is an essential need to explore the potential of novel and alternative therapies. Strengthening of the diagnostic aspects is also suggested as in most cases Arcobacters goes unnoticed and hence the exact epidemiological status remains uncertain.

Such large-scale land use changes could profoundly impact working landscapes and the arthropod communities that inhabit them. We review the literature on dedicated biofuel crops and biomass harvest from forests to look for commonalities in arthropod community responses. With expanded biofuel production, existing arthropod pests of biofuel crops will likely become more important and new pests will emerge. Beneficial arthropods will also be influenced by biofuel crop habitats, potentially altering the distribution of pollination and pest control services to the surrounding landscape. Production of biofuel crops including initial crop selection, genetic improvement, agronomic practices, and harvest regimes will also influence arthropod communities. In turn, arthropods will impact the productivity and species composition of biomass production systems. Some of these processes have the potential to cause landscape-level changes in arthropod community dynamics and insect-vectored plant diseases. Finally, changes in arthropod populations and their spatiotemporal distribution in the landscape will have impacts on consumers of insects at higher trophic levels, potentially influencing their population and community dynamics and producing feedbacks to arthropod communities. Given that dedicated biofuel crops and intensified biomass harvest from forests are still relatively uncommon in North America, as they increase, we anticipate 'predictably unpredictable' shifts in arthropod communities and the ecosystem services and functions they support. We suggest that research on arthropod dynamics within biofuel crops, their spillover into adjacent habitats, and implications for the sustainability of working landscapes are critical topics for both basic and applied investigations."

As more countries move toward implementation and/or strengthening of their infectious disease surveillance programs, the strengthening of clinical microbiology laboratories becomes increasingly important because they serve as the first line responders to detect new and emerging microbial threats, re-emerging infectious diseases, the spread of antibiotic resistance, and the possibility of bioterrorism. In fact, IHR(2005) Core Capacity #8, ""Laboratory"", requires that laboratory services be a part of every phase of alert and response. Public health laboratories in many resource-constrained countries require financial and technical assistance to build their capacity. In recognition of this, in 2006, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) established an International Laboratory Capacity Building Program, LabCap, housed under the ASM International Board. ASM LabCap utilizes ASM's vast resources and its membership's expertise-40,000 microbiologists worldwide-to strengthen clinical and public health laboratory systems in low and low-middle income countries. ASM LabCap's program activities align with IHR(2005) by building the capability of resource-constrained countries to develop quality-assured, laboratory-based information which is critical to disease surveillance and the rapid detection of disease outbreaks, whether they stem from natural, deliberate or accidental causes. ASM LabCap helps build laboratory capacity under a cooperative agreement with the U. S.

Risks include the occurrence of infectious diseases, in particular zoonoses, and the high antibiotic use in livestock production contributing to emergence of antibiotic resistance and its spread from animals to humans. On the other hand, many infectious diseases of animals and humans have been eliminated, including brucellosis, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, and BSE, resulting in an animal husbandry that perhaps has never been as safe as nowadays. So while many health risks have been brought under control, the public opinion appears to reflect a feeling of anxiety and mistrust in authorities and producers to deal with the potential and remaining public health risks associated with animal husbandry. These risks, often associated with the intensification of animal production, are nonetheless indeed real. An animal husbandry that is ""completely"" safe and healthy for humans and animals requires a central role for disease prevention in the design and management of animal husbandry systems. It also requires that rapid and adequate responses are taken by veterinary and medical authorities on both perceived and real risks. Communication on health risks must be complete and open. Because actions to protect the health of animals often also benefit human health, there is usually no conflict of interests between humans and animals regarding their health needs. We emphasize the need to use the precautionary principle in matters of human and animal health. This implies that there must not be a ""clash of cultures"" between medical and veterinary professionals and policy makers. (C) 2013 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.

They provide vital ecosystem services, some species are useful models in biomedical research and some are held as pet animals. However, many rodent species can have adverse effects such as damage to crops and stored produce, and they are of health concern because of the transmission of pathogens to humans and livestock. The first rodent viruses were discovered by isolation approaches and resulted in break-through knowledge in immunology, molecular and cell biology, and cancer research. In addition to rodent-specific viruses, rodent-borne viruses are causing a large number of zoonotic diseases. Most prominent examples are reemerging outbreaks of human hemorrhagic fever disease cases caused by arena-and hantaviruses. In addition, rodents are reservoirs for vector-borne pathogens, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus and Borrelia spp., and may carry human pathogenic agents, but likely are not involved in their transmission to human. In our days, next-generation sequencing or high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing the speed of the discovery of novel viruses, but other molecular approaches, such as generic RT-PCR/PCR and rolling circle amplification techniques, contribute significantly to the rapidly ongoing process. However, the current knowledge still represents only the tip of the iceberg, when comparing the known human viruses to those known for rodents, the mammalian taxon with the largest species number. The diagnostic potential of HTS-based metagenomic approaches is illustrated by their use in the discovery and complete genome determination of novel borna-and adenoviruses as causative disease agents in squirrels. In conclusion, HTS, in combination with conventional RT-PCR/PCR-based approaches, resulted in a drastically increased knowledge of the diversity of rodent viruses. Future improvements of the used workflows, including bioinformatics analysis, will further enhance our knowledge and preparedness in case of the emergence of novel viruses. Classical virological and additional molecular approaches are needed for genome annotation and functional characterization of novel viruses, discovered by these technologies, and evaluation of their zoonotic potential."

The IHR(2005) require countries to assess the ability of their national structures, capacities, and resources to meet the minimum requirements for surveillance and response. This report describes the results of the assessment undertaken in Uganda. Methods We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional assessment using the protocol developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The data collection tools were adapted locally and administered to a convenience sample of IHR(2005) stakeholders, and frequency analyses were performed. Results Ugandan national laws relevant to the IHR(2005) existed, but they did not adequately support the full implementation of the IHR(2005). Correspondingly, there was a designated IHR National Focal Point (NFP), but surveillance activities and operational communications were limited to the health sector. All the districts (13/13) had designated disease surveillance offices, most had IDSR technical guidelines (92%, or 12/13), and all (13/13) had case definitions for infectious and zoonotic diseases surveillance. Surveillance guidelines were available at 57% (35/61) of the health facilities, while case definitions were available at 66% (40/61) of the health facilities. The priority diseases list, surveillance guidelines, case definitions and reporting tools were based on the IDSR strategy and hence lacked information on the IHR(2005). The rapid response teams at national and district levels lacked food safety, chemical and radio-nuclear experts. Similarly, there were no guidelines on the outbreak response to food, chemical and radio-nuclear hazards. Comprehensive preparedness plans incorporating IHR(2005) were lacking at national and district levels. A national laboratory policy existed and the strategic plan was being drafted. However, there were critical gaps hampering the efficient functioning of the national laboratory network. Finally, the points of entry for IHR(2005) implementation had not been designated. Conclusions The assessment highlighted critical gaps to guide the IHR(2005) planning process. The IHR(2005) action plan should therefore be developed to foster national and international public health security."

Earlier studies have provided evidence that indirect markers of adrenergic drive, such as plasma or urinary norepinephrine as well as heart rate, often display an increase in the hypertensive state. Direct recording of efferent postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve traffic via microneurography and regional norepinephrine spillover technique have conclusively documented the occurrence of an adrenergic overdrive in hypertension, showing that the sympathetic activation is directly related to the severity of the hypertensive state and is widespread to different cardiovascular districts. The present review will focus on some major features of the ""neuroadrenergic hypothesis of hypertension."" In particular it will examine the mechanisms responsible for the adrenergic overdrive, the relationships between the sympathetic activation and the metabolic disarray of frequent detection in the hypertensive state, and the participation of neuroadrenergic factors at the development of the hypertension-related target organ damage. Further issues addressed will be the contribution of the hyperadrenergic state to the different patterns of the 24- hour blood pressure profile as well as to the day/night blood pressure variability described in the hypertensive state and the behavior of the sympathetic function in the hypertensive states complicated by the presence of other cardiovascular or metabolic disease. Finally, the clinical and therapeutic implications of the neuroadrenergic abnormalities occurring in hypertension, as well as the areas worthy of future research, will be highlighted.

This article first compares the pathogenesis of avian, swine and human influenza viruses in their natural hosts. The major aim was to evaluate the zoonotic potential of swine and avian viruses, and the possible role of pigs in the transmission of AI viruses to humans. Cross-species transfers of swine and avian influenza to humans have been documented on several occasions, but all these viruses lacked the critical capacity to spread from human-to-human. The extreme virulence of H5N1 in humans has been associated with excessive virus replication in the lungs and a prolonged overproduction of cytokines by the host, but there remain many questions about the exact viral cell and tissue tropism. Though pigs are susceptible to several AI subtypes, including H5N1, there is clearly a serious barrier to infection of pigs with such viruses. AI viruses frequently undergo reassortment in pigs, but there is no proof for a role of pigs in the generation of the 1957 or 1968 pandemic reassortants, or in the transmission of H5N1 or other wholly avian viruses to humans. The major conclusion is that cross-species transmission of influenza viruses per se is insufficient to start a human influenza pandemic and that animal influenza viruses must undergo dramatic but largely unknown genetic changes to become established in the human population."

Until recently, HPAI viruses were rarely isolated from wild birds, but for LPAI viruses extremely high isolation rates have been recorded in surveillance studies. Influenza viruses may infect all types of domestic or captive birds in all areas of the world. The frequency with which primary infections occur in any type of bird usually depends on the degree of contact there is with feral birds. Secondary spread is typically associated with human involvement, either by birds or bird product movement or by transferring infective faeces from infected to susceptible birds, but potentially wild birds can be involved. In recent years the frequency of HPAI outbreaks appears to have increased and there have been particularly costly outbreaks of HPAI in densely populated poultry areas in Italy, The Netherlands and Canada. In each outbreak millions of birds were slaughtered to bring the outbreaks under control. Since the 1990s, AI infections due to two subtypes have been widespread in poultry across a large area of the World.

Since the 1990s, AI infections due to two subtypes, LPAI H9N2 and HPAI H5N1, have been widespread in poultry across large areas of the world, resulting in a modified eco-epidemiology and a zoonotic potential. An extraordinary effort is required to manage these epidemics from both the human and animal health perspectives."

In 2013, another novel influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged in China, and 30% of those patients died. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to avian influenza and are more likely to develop severe complications and to die, especially when infection occurs in the middle and late trimesters. Viremia is believed to occur infrequently, and thus vertical transmission induced by avian influenza appears to be rare. However, avian influenza increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, preterm birth and fatal distress. This review summarises 39 cases of pregnant women and their fetuses from different countries dating back to 1997, including 11, 15 and 13 infections with H7N9, H5N1 and the 2009 pandemic influenza (H1N1), respectively. We analysed the epidemic features, following the geographical, population and pregnancy trimester distributions; underlying diseases; exposure history; medical timelines; human-to-human transmission; pathogenicity and vertical transmission; antivirus treatments; maternal severity and mortality and pregnancy outcome. The common experiences reported in different countries and areas suggest that early identification and treatment are imperative. In the future, vigilant virologic and epidemiologic surveillance systems should be developed to monitor avian influenza viruses during pregnancy. Furthermore, extensive study on the immune mechanisms should be conducted, as this will guide safe, rational immunomodulatory treatment among this high-risk population. Most importantly, we should develop a universal avian influenza virus vaccine to prevent outbreaks of the different subtypes. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Avian influenza virus (AIV) infections may be asymptomatic or present as mild conjunctivitis in humans; however, H5N1 infections may present as severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory disease syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and death. Since 2003, there have been a total of 436 cases and 262 deaths due to H5N1 infections. The number of cases has decreased steadily since 2006; however, the emergence of multiple genetically distinct sublineages of H5N1 has continued. These emerging sublineages display varying levels of drug resistance and in some cases an increased preference for binding to human alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid cellular receptors. Though H5N1 has not shown efficient transmissibility between humans, the rapid evolution of the virus presents a concern for the emergence of a virus with this capability.

Historically, from 1878 through 1955, fowl plaque was described as a high mortality disease of poultry in many countries throughout Europe, Asia, North and South America and Africa and the etiology was proved to be a filterable virus. In the 1930s through the 1950s, fowl plaque disappeared as an endemic disease in most part of the world. In 1949, the first report of a low virulent disease in chickens caused by LPAI virus was reported. In 1955, the etiological of fowl plaque was determined to be influenza A virus, which subsequently was identified as the H7 subtype. In 1959, a ""fowl plaque-like"" outbreak was described in chickens, which was the first report of fowl plaque caused by a non-H7 AI virus, i.e. first fowl plaque outbreak from H5 subtype of AI virus. In 1961 the first wild birds infection and deaths were reported in common terns of South Africa. In 1966 and 1971, the first H5 and H7 LPAI viruses, respectively were identified; prior to this period, only HPAI viruses had H5 and H7 subtypes. In 1970, the AGID serological test was introduced, which allowed easy and rapid identification of AI virus-infected poultry flocks. In 1972, there was the first isolation of LPAI viruses in asymptomatic wild birds: ducks in the United State and shorebirds in Australia. In 1981, the term ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" was accepted as standard nomenclature for fowl plaque and related synonyms. In 1983, LPAI virus was observed mutating to HPAI virus during LPAI field outbreak, and specific genomic changes were identified in the proteolytic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin responsible for the virulence change. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, molecular criteria were added to the definition for classifying an AI virus as HPAI. In 2002, there were the first reported infections and deaths in a wide variety of wild bird species from AI virus H5NI HPAI virus. The primary goal of this review is to highlight the global situation of HPAI and provide baseline information to show the potential pandemic nature of the virus, so that control and prevention strategies can be improved."

Avian colibacillosis is a complex syndrome characterized by multiple organ lesions with airsacculitis and associated pericarditis, perihepatitis and peritonitis being most typical. Environmental factors as well as the constitution of poultry or initial viral infections influence the outcome of APEC-infections. However, several challenge experiments in chickens proofed the role of virulent APEC strains as the single aetiological agent. Currently serotypes O1:K1, O2:K1 and O78:K80 are recognized as the most prevalent, however the number of published serotypes is increasing. In addition, single APEC isolates vary profoundly in virulence, and knowledge about the molecular basis of this variability is still scarce. Known virulence factors of APEC are adhesins (F I and P-fimbriae), iron acquisition systems (aerobactin and yersiniabactin), hemolysins (hemolysinE and temperaturesensitive hemagglutinin), resistance to the bactericidal effects of serum and phagocytosis (outer membrane protein, iss protein, lipopolysaccharide, K/1)-capsule and colilcin production) as well as toxins and cytotoxins (heat stable toxin, cyto-/verotoxin and flagella toxin). Esperimental studies have shown that the respiratory tract, principally the gas-exchange region of the lung and the interstitium of the air sacs are the most important sites of entry for avian pathogenic E. coli. APEC strains adhere to the epithelial cells of air sacs presumably through F1-fimbriae. After colonization and multiplication the bacteria enter the bloodstream, and the temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin(tsh) seems to be important int his step. After invading the bloodstream APEC cause a septicemia resulting in massive lesins in multiple internal organs and in sudden death of the birds. The ability of the bacteria to acquire iron and the resistance to the bactericidal effects of serum, predominantly conferred by the increased serum survival (iss) - protein, enables APEC to multiply quickly in their hosts. Iss is regarded a specific genetic marker for avian pathogenic E. colistrains. A critical review of the literature published so far on APEC reveals, that these pathotypes are not defined appropriately. This findings urge investigations on the population structure of APEC, enabling the establishment of appropriate diagnostic tools and avoiding the obsolete use of serotyping for APEC diagnosis. So far more than 20 APEC strains have been investigated in animal experiments, explaining contrary published results. Thus, the lack of knowledge in pathogenicity and in immunity of APEC infections urges further experimental studies. As APEC share not only identical serotypes with human pathogens but also specific virulence factors, their zoonotic potential is under consideration."

Babesia microti and Babesia divergens are the etiological agents of human babesiosis. Babesia canis is the principal etiological agent of canine babesiosis. Currently, the diagnostics of babesiosis is based mainly on serological methods and the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFA) is most commonly used. However, even in the acute phase of the disease, seroconversion does not always occur. Clinical symptoms, because of their unspecificity, cannot be used to make a correct diagnosis. In this situation other diagnostic methods are needed. The use of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is the most promising of these. An advantage of this method is that it allows identification of the parasite in the early stage of disease which enables early diagnosis, implementation of therapy and avoidance of complications. However, the standardization of this technique remains to be carried out. Selection of a genetic marker for PCR is very important for the sensitivity of this technique and it is discussed in this paper."

However, Western cultures generally do not practice this food habit (entomophagy) despite its advantages for the present and future of human nutrition. Little is known of the microbiological hazards associated with NCA consumption. Scope and approach: The present review summarizes the bacteriological findings on raw arthropod taxa containing edible species. In a second step, it shows potential of bacteria to impair food hygiene and food safety for the human consumer by relating the bacteria found to human diseases. Key findings and conclusions: Many bacterial species are known to affect invertebrates and humans alike (e.g. Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Rickettsiella spp.). Furthermore, insects can act as carriers for human pathogens if not obtained from a hygienic environment (e.g. salmonellae, Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp.). As with other foodstuffs of animal origin, exclusion of clinically diseased specimens, hygienic obtention, washing and thorough heating seem suitable procedures to reduce the risk of food-borne diseases by bacteria, following the tradition of most NCA-consuming communities. Raw consumption of insects should be evaluated thoroughly, even when being traditional, because environmental changes could affect a previously valid innocuousness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Bd was described in 1999 and has been linked with declines since the 1970s, while Bsal is a more recently discovered pathogen that was described in 2013. It is hypothesized that Bsal originated in Asia and spread via international trade to Europe, where it has been linked to salamander die-offs. Trade in live amphibians thus represents a significant threat to global biodiversity in amphibians. We review the current state of knowledge regarding Bsal and describe the risk of Bsal spread. We discuss regional responses to Bsal and barriers that impede a rapid, coordinated global effort.

Three major infectious diseases, namely AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, are killing around 8 million people in the world annually. Although drugs effective against these infectious diseases are available at present, drastic therapeutics have not been developed yet. In addition, vaccines against these diseases often cannot prevent infections, because pathogenic viruses or bacteria evade the immune system of the host. Many diseases and emerging infections of pathogenic bacteria cannot be controlled by conventional pharmaceutics. These pathogens secrete regulatory factors. When the produced regulatory factor attains a certain level, an active factor is then produced by the pathogen to destroy the host. Considering these phenomena, we thought investigating characteristic regulatory or active factors will pave the way for developing novel vaccines or diagnostic drugs. Therefore, candidiasis was selected as a model, and application of the secretory protease of Candida albicans was examined for the development of novel drugs. Screening of novel candidates of antigens of C. albicans and vaccine development are also underway.

Foodborne pathogens cause severe diseases to human beings including infants. Although a large number of foodbornepathogens exist, the overall increase in the number of infections is of relatively few emerging serotypes and phage types. A variety of foodborne pathogens have risen and fallen within large geographic regions, associated with several meta-outbreaks. Recently the emergence of resistance of foodborne pathogens to the antimicrobial drugs appears to pose a particular health risk. Several reports have indicated that infection due to the consumption of food contaminated with foodborne pathogens is associated with increased risk for invasive illness, and death. In general, antimicrobial drug resistance occurs frequently in zoonotic foodborne pathogens and is largely promoted by using antimicrobial drugs in food practices. Foodborne pathogens have become a matter of great concern because of their rapid dissemination and their ability to readily acquire additional resistance traits to other clinically important antimicrobial drug classes. There has been an increasing interest worldwide on versatile potential of natural products in controlling foodborne pathogens in food commodities using essential oils, especially from plant origin. This review deals with the novel findings on essential oils and their compounds for their possible applications in food industry against the foodborne pathogens.A reliable amount of description on the practical applications of essential oils in food practices has been described.

Dengue fever may cause potentially deadly hemorrhagic symptoms and is endemic in the tropical and sub-tropical world, being also a serious threat to temperate countries in the developed world. Effective diagnostics for dengue should be able to discriminate among the four antigenically related dengue serotypes and fulfill the requirements for successful decentralized (point-of-care) testing in the harsh environmental conditions found in most tropical regions.

Protecting the blood supply from emerging infectious threats remains a serious concern in the transfusion medicine community. Transfusion services can employ indirect measures such as surveillance, hemovigilance, and donor questioning (defense), protein-, or nucleic acid based direct testing (detection), or pathogen inactivation of blood products (destruction) as strategies to mitigate the risk of transmission-transmitted infection. In the North American context, emerging threats currently include dengue, chikungunya, and hepatitis E viruses, and Babesia protozoan parasites. The 2003 SARS and 2014 Ebola outbreaks illustrate the potential of epidemics unlikely to be transmitted by blood transfusion but disruptive to blood systems. Donor-free blood products such as ex vivo generated red blood cells offer a theoretical way to avoid transmission-transmitted infection risk, although biological, engineering, and manufacturing challenges must be overcome before this approach becomes practical. Similarly, next generation sequencing of all nucleic acid in a blood sample is currently possible but impractical for generalized screening. Pathogen inactivation systems are in use in different jurisdictions around the world, and are starting to gain regulatory approval in North America. Cost concerns make it likely that pathogen inactivation will be contemplated by blood operators through the lens of health economics and risk-based decision making, rather than in zero-risk paradigms previously embraced for transfusable products. Defense of the blood supply from infectious disease risk will continue to require innovative combinations of surveillance, detection, and pathogen avoidance or inactivation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This expansion has not happened in isolation and the disease has been expanding into Southern and Eastern Europe for the last decade. This shifting disease distribution is being facilitated by a number of different introduction mechanisms including the movement of infected livestock, the passive movement of infected Culicoides on the wind and, in NW Europe, an unknown route of introduction. The expansion of BTV in Europe has forced a re-evaluation of the importance of Palaearctic Culicoides species in transmission, as well as the importance of secondary transmission routes, such as transplacental transmission, in facilitating the persistence of the virus. The current European outbreak of BTV-8 is believed to have caused greater economic damage than any previous single-serotype outbreak.

According to OIE, it is the second most important zoonotic disease in the world after rabies. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep, goats, camels and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants and marine mammals. The disease is manifested by late term abortions, weak calves, still births, infertility and characteristic lesions are primarily placentitis, epididymitis and orchitis. The organism is excreted in uterine discharges and milk. The disease is economically important, is one of the most devastating transboundary animal diseases and also a major trade barrier. Although not yet reported, some species of Brucella (e. g., B. abortus) are zoonotic and could be used as bioweapons. Brucellosis has a considerable impact on animal and human health, as well as wide socio-economic impacts, especially in countries in which rural income relies largely on livestock breeding and dairy products. Considering the poor health infrastructure and manpower in rural areas, the focus should be on preventive measures coupled with strengthening the curative health care services for early diagnosis and treatment. The incidence of brucellosis is increasing particularly in large dairy herds in Pakistan. Several studies have been conducted using serodiagnostic techniques to determine the prevalence of brucellosis in different provinces, districts and livestock farms in government and private sector.

The major biological and socio-economical factors attributing to the low productivity includes: the low genetic potential and performance, poor nutrition ( in quality and quantity terms), the prevailing of different diseases, traditional way of husbandry systems and inadequate skilled manpower, among others. Ethiopia is one of the African countries where tuberculosis is wide spread in both humans and cattle and the endemic nature of tuberculosis in humans and cattle has long been documented. The disease is considered as one of the major livestock diseases that results in high morbidity and mortality, although the current status on the actual prevalence rate of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) at a national level is yet unknown. Detection of BTB in Ethiopia is carried out most commonly on the basis of tuberculin skin testing, abattoir meat inspection and very rarely on bacteriological techniques. Recently undertaken studies indicated the prevalence rate of BTB with a range of 3.4% (in small holder production system) to 50% (in intensive dairy productions) and a range of 3.5% to 5.2% in slaughterhouses in various places of the country. BTB in cattle remains to be a great concern due to the susceptibility of humans to the disease. The infections mainly take place by drinking raw milk and occur in the extra-pulmonary form, in the cervical lymphadenitis form in particular. The aim of this paper is to review the status of BTB in Ethiopia in relation with the existing animal husbandry systems and abattoir meat inspection surveillances. Control measures, economic impacts and the zoonotic aspect of the disease are also briefly addressed."

In epidemiology, further clarifications of epidemiological functions are needed: while host roles may be defined, they are often used loosely, partly because of a lack of clarity on the relationships between a host's function and its epidemiological role. Here we focus on the definition of bridge hosts and their epidemiological consequences. Bridge hosts provide a link through which pathogens can be transmitted from maintenance host populations or communities to receptive populations that people want to protect (i.e., target hosts). A bridge host should (1) be competent for the pathogen or able to mechanically transmit it; and (2) come into direct contact or share habitat with both maintenance and target populations. Demonstration of bridging requires an operational framework that integrates ecological and epidemiological approaches. We illustrate this framework using the example of the transmission of Avian Influenza Viruses across wild bird/poultry interfaces in Africa and discuss a range of other examples that demonstrate the usefulness of our definition for other multi-host systems. Bridge hosts can be particularly important for understanding and managing infectious disease dynamics in multi-host systems at wildlife/domestic/human interfaces, including emerging infections."

In humans, the disease is caused mainly by: B. melitensis as the most pathogenic species, followed by B. suis, whereas B. abortus is considered as the mildest type of brucellosis. The natural reservoir of the germ and the source of infection in humans are infected domestic animals, primarily cattle, sheep, goats, as well as wild animals. Infection in humans occurs by penetration through damaged skin, conjunctiva, and more rarely via the alimentary route by the consumption of infected products. Especially exposed are: veterinarians, veterinary technicians, insemination service employees, zoo technicians, farmers working on multi-herd farms (production cooperatives), e.g. cattlemen, also private farmers, employees of slaughter houses and meat processing enterprises. A basis for diagnosing brucellosis are serologic tests which allow the detection of antibodies occurring in response to infection, performed with the use of the following methods: agglutination test, complement fixation test, Coombs test, 2-mercaptoethanol agglutination test, and Burnet's intradermal allergy test which detects the state of hypersensitivity of the infected organism to Brucella abortus rods."

It is a costly, highly contagious disease that affects ruminants, cattle, sheep, goats, and other productive animals such as pigs. Symptoms include abortions, infertility, decreased milk production, weight loss, and lameness. Brucellosis is also the most common bacterial disease that is transmitted from animals to humans, with approximately 500 000 new human cases each year. Detection and slaughter of infected animals is required to eradicate the disease, as vaccination alone is currently insufficient. However, as the most protective vaccines compromise serodiagnosis, this creates policy dilemmas, and these often result in the failure of eradication and control programs. Detection of antibodies to the Brucella bacterial cell wall O-polysaccharide (OPS) component of smooth lipopolysaccharide is used in diagnosis of this disease, and the same molecule contributes important protective efficacy to currently deployed veterinary whole-cell vaccines. This has set up a long-standing paradox that while Brucella OPS confers protective efficacy to vaccines, its presence results in similar antibody profiles in infected and vaccinated animals. Consequently, differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is not possible, and this limits efforts to combat the disease. Recent clarification of the chemical structure of Brucella OPS as a block copolymer of two oligosaccharide sequences has provided an opportunity to utilize unique oligosaccharides only available via chemical synthesis in serodiagnostic tests for the disease. These oligosaccharides show excellent sensitivity and specificity compared with the native polymer used in current commercial tests and have the added advantage of assisting discrimination between brucellosis and infections caused by several bacteria with OPS that share some structural features with those of Brucella. During synthesis and immunochemical evaluation of these synthetic antigens, it became apparent that an opportunity existed to create a polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine that would not create antibodies that give false positive results in diagnostic tests for infection. This objective was reduced to practice, and immunization of mice showed that antibodies to the Brucella A antigen could be developed without reacting in a diagnostic test based on the M antigen. A conjugate vaccine of this type could readily be developed for use in humans and animals. However, as chemical methods advance and modern methods of bacterial engineering mature, it is expected that the principles elucidated by these studies could be applied to the development of an inexpensive and cost-effective vaccine to combat endemic brucellosis in animals."

Bone lesions may include reactive osteitis or osteomyelitis beneath skin lesions, or metastatic osteomyelitis from lymphohematogenous spread of M. ulcerans. Pathogenesis is related to a necrotizing and immunosuppressive toxin produced by M. ulcerans, called mycolactone. The incidence of BU is highest in children up to 15 years old, and is a major public health problem in endemic countries due to disabling scarring and destruction of bone. Most patients live in West Africa, but the disease has been confirmed in at least 30 countries. Treatment options for BU are antibiotics and surgery. BCG vaccination provides short-term protection against M. ulcerans infection and prevents osteomyelitis. HIV infection may increase risk for BU, and renders BU highly aggressive. Unlike leprosy and tuberculosis, BU is related to environmental factors and is thus considered non-communicable. The most plausible mode of transmission is by skin trauma at sites contaminated by M. ulcerans.

In addition to the two known serotypes of CCoV, novel recombinant variants of CCoV have been found containing spike protein N-terminal domains (NTDs) that are closely related to those of feline and porcine strains. The increase in disease severity in dogs and the emergence of novel CCoVs can be attributed to the high level of recombination within the spike gene that can occur during infection by more than one CCoV type in the same host."

Infection with Leishmania infantum is considerably more prevalent than clinical disease, and infected dogs with no signs of disease might, potentially, transmit infection. Diagnosis of asymptomatic infection by serology is insufficient and PCR markedly increases its sensitivity. A new therapy exclusively for canine leishmaniosis is needed because current drugs do not reliably eliminate infection and might provoke resistance. Protection against sand-fly bites by topical insecticides is effective in reducing infection, and recent development of vaccines has indicated that prevention by vaccination is feasible. Integrated prevention with topical insecticides reducing the feeding of vectors and vaccination blocking early infection would be the basis of successful control programs."

A random-effects model was used to evaluate cardiac autonomic modulation and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) between women with PCOS and controls. Eight studies were included, including 243 PCOS and 211 controls. Overall, women with PCOS had significantly lower standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN) and percentage of the number of interval differences of successive normal-to-normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms among the total number of RR intervals (pNN50), higher MSNA frequency and higher MSNA incidence than controls.

Although hippos are typically regarded as obligate herbivores and short-grass grazing specialists, field studies have demonstrated that hippos are facultative carnivores that consume flesh and intestinal tissues from the carcasses of other animals. Carnivory by hippos is not an aberrant behaviour restricted to particular individuals in certain localities, but a behaviour pattern that occurs within populations distributed in most of the hippo's current range in eastern and southern Africa. Carnivory is frequently associated with communal feeding involving multiple individuals or entire social groups of hippos. The observed tendency of hippos to feed on carcasses, including those of other hippos, has important implications for the ecology and epidemiology of anthrax and other ungulate-associated zoonotic diseases in African landscapes. Scavenging and carnivory by hippos may explain why the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of anthrax mortality among hippos often differ markedly from those of other anthrax-susceptible herbivores within the same habitats, and why levels of hippo mortality from anthrax may be orders of magnitude higher than those of other anthrax-susceptible ungulate populations within the same localities. Recognition of the role of carnivory as a key factor in modulating the dynamics of mass anthrax outbreaks in hippos can provide a basis for improved understanding and management of the effects of anthrax outbreaks in hippo and human populations."

This may be due to the fact that ecological change and disease emergence are often mediated through complex and large-scale processes that are not amenable to traditional reductionist approaches to causal inference. Here, we suggest strategies assembled from diverse disciplines, including ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences, to analyze complex relationships, promote cooperation, increase efficiency, and minimize bias when investigating the ecological drivers of disease emergence. These techniques, which complement traditional hypothesis testing, include epidemiologic causal criteria, strong inference, causal diagrams, model selection, and triangulation. We also present several examples from recent emerging infectious disease investigations, including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, coral diseases, and avian influenza, where these techniques were successfully applied.

For vaccine production, it has become evident that cell culture technology can be considered as a key milestone and has been the result of decades of progress. The development and implementation of cell substrates have permitted massive and safe production of viral vaccines. The demand in new vaccines against emerging viral diseases, the increasing vaccine production volumes, and the stringent safety rules for manufacturing have made cell substrates mandatory viral vaccine producer factories. In this review, we focus on cell substrates for the production of vaccines against human viral diseases. Depending on the nature of the vaccine, choice of the cell substrate is critical. Each manufacturer intending to develop a new vaccine candidate should assess several cell substrates during the early development phase in order to select the most convenient for the application. First, as vaccine safety is quite naturally a central concern of Regulatory Agencies, the cell substrate has to answer the regulatory rules stringency. In addition, the cell substrate has to be competitive in terms of viral-specific production yields and manufacturing costs. No cell substrate, even the so-called ""designer"" cell lines, is able to fulfil all the requested criteria for all viral vaccines. Therefore, the availability of a variety of cell substrates for vaccine production is essential because it improves the chance to successfully respond to the current and future needs of vaccines linked to new emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g. pandemic flu, Ebola, and Chikungunya outbreaks).

CWD-forms ( spheroplasts) of bacteria are commonly prepared in vitro and are used for various practical applications. However, very little is known about the conditions required for the formation of CWD-forms of bacteria and mycobacteria in vivo and their significance in aetiology of various chronic diseases of humans ( tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and Crohn's disease) and animals ( paratuberculosis). It is quite difficult to detect CWD-forms of mycobacteria in biological material and the possibilities of their detection by microscopy, culture, DNA hybridization techniques and other methods are limited. This obviously leads to a relatively small amount of published data on the detection and the isolation of CWD-forms of mycobacteria both from human or veterinary biological material, which can lead to the conclusion of a non-infectious origin of the diseases. The present review also includes studies performed by authors from the former Soviet Union and likely represents the first complete summarization of their knowledge in this sphere.

There are uncertainties regarding whether there will be a pandemic, if it will be caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus, when or where it will occur, how imminent or how severe it will be. No one can accurately predict if and when a given virus will become a pandemic virus. Pandemic prevention strategies must be based on preparing for the unexpected and being capable of reacting accordingly There is growing evidence that infection control measures were helpful in containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as avian influenza. Compliance of standard infection control measures, intensive promotion of hand and respiratory hygiene, vigilance and triage of patients with febrile illness, and specific infection control measures are key components to contain a highly contagious disease in hospital and to protect healthcare workers, patients and visitors. The importance of standard precautions for any patient and cleaning and disinfection for the healthcare environment cannot be overemphasized. SARS illustrated dramatically the potential of air travel and globalization for the dissemination of an emerging infectious disease. To prevent the potential serious consequences of pandemic influenza, timely implementation of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions locally within the outbreak area is the key to minimizing global spread. Herein, we relate our perspective on useful lessons derived from a review of the SARS epidemic that may be useful to physicians, especially when looking ahead to the next epidemic."

Policy decision-makers should be well-versed in the public health importance of accurate and reliable census data for emergency preparedness planning, controlling disease outbreaks, and for addressing health concerns among vulnerable populations including the elderly, low-income, racial/ethnic minorities, and special residential groups (e.g., nursing homes). Valid census information is critical to ensure that policy makers and public health practitioners have the evidence needed to: (1) establish incidence rates, mortality rates, and prevalence for the full characterization of emerging health issues; (2) address disparities in health care, prevention strategies and health outcomes among vulnerable populations; and (3) plan and effectively respond in times of disaster and emergency.

During the 2003 epidemic, the disease rapidly spread from its origin in southern China to other countries and affected almost 8000 patients, which resulted in about 800 fatalities. A chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease named 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) is essential for the life cycle of the SARS-CoV. This main protease is responsible for maturation of functional proteins and represents a key anti-viral target. HPLC and fluorescence-based assays have been used to characterize the protease and to determine the potency of the inhibitors. The fluorogenic method monitoring the increase of fluorescence from the cleavage of a peptide substrate containing an Edans-Dabcyl fluorescence quenching pair at two ends has enabled the use of high throughput screening to speed up the drug discovery process. Several groups of inhibitors have been identified through high throughput screening and rational drug design approaches. Thus, alpha,beta-unsaturated peptidomimetics, anilides, metal-conjugated compounds, boronic acids, quinolinecarboxylate derivatives, thiophenecarboxylates, phthalhydrazide-substituted ketoglutamine analogues, isatin and natural products have been identified as potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV main protease. The different classes of inhibitors reported in these studies are summarized in this review. Some of these inhibitors could be developed into potential drug candidates, which may provide a solution to combat possible reoccurrence of the SARS and other life-threatening viruses with 3CL proteases."

Internet search engines were queried with key words to identify scientific articles on the efficacy, safety, and toxicity of chemical and plant-derived topical insect repellants and insecticides to meet these objectives. Data sources reviewed included case reports; case series; observational, longitudinal, and surveillance studies; and entomological and toxicological studies.

The insecticide-treated clothing would provide contact-level insecticidal effects and provide better, longer lasting protection against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes and ticks than topical DEET or picaridin alone. In special cases, where environmental exposures to disease transmitting ticks, biting midges, sandflies, or blackflies are anticipated, topical insect repellents containing IR3535, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane-3, 8-diol or PMD) would offer better topical protection than topical DEET alone."

The disease is almost self-limiting and rarely fatal. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a RNA virus belonging to family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus. Molecular characterization has demonstrated two distinct lineages of strains which cause epidemics in Africa and Asia. These geographical genotypes exhibit differences in the transmission cycles. In contrast to Africa where sylvatic cycle is maintained between monkeys and wild mosquitoes, in Asia the cycle continues between humans and the Aedes aegypti mosquito. CHIKV is known to cause epidemics after a period of quiescence. The first recorded epidemic occurred in Tanzania in 1952-1953. In Asia, CHIK activity was documented since its isolation in Bangkok, Thailand in 1958. Virus transmission continued till 1964. After hiatus, the virus activity re-appeared in the mid-1970s and declined by 1976. In India, well-documented outbreaks occurred in 1963 and 1964 in Kolkata and southern India, respectively. Thereafter, a small outbreak of CHIK was reported from Sholapur district, Maharashtra in 1973. CHIKV emerged in the islands of South West Indian Ocean viz. French island of La Reunion, Mayotee, Mauritius and Seychelles which are reporting the outbreak since February, 2005. After quiescence of about three decades, CHIKV re-emerged in India in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu since December, 2005. Cases have also been reported from Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kerala. The outbreak is still continuing.

The disease is caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arthropod-borne virus that is transmitted to humans primarily via the bite of an infected mosquito. Since a re-emergence of CHIKV in 2004, the virus has spread into novel locations, such as Europe, and has led to millions of cases of disease throughout countries in and around the Indian Ocean. The risk of importation of CHIKV into new areas is ever present because of the high attack rates associated with the recurring epidemics, the high levels of viremia in infected humans, and the worldwide distribution of the vectors responsible for transmitting CHIKV. In this review, we will characterize the epidemiology and global expansion of CHIKV, describe the clinical features and laboratory testing for the disease, and discuss priorities for further studies needed for effective disease control and prevention."

Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) have a particularly high risk of acquiring certain infections during travel. Chinese VFR travellers account for a substantial proportion of all travel in Western countries with high migrant populations. Methods: A literature review was undertaken regarding major infectious disease risks for VFR travellers visiting China. This included an examination of the previous pandemics arising in China, the likelihood of future outbreaks in China from H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses, the potential role of travellers in disease transmission, and the special risks for VFR travellers. Results: China has been the origin of several influenza pandemics in past few decades, and the origin of several emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential, including SARS. Travel to and from China has the potential for global spread of emergent infectious diseases, as seen in the SARS outbreak in 2003. For VFR travellers, the risk of other infectious diseases may also be greater in China compared to their countries of migration, including hepatitis A and B, dengue fever, typhoid, and other diseases. Conclusions: VFR travel to China may be associated with increased risk of acquiring a range of infectious diseases, and also poses a potential risk for importation of future pandemics to other countries. Chinese VFR travellers need to be cognisant of these risks and health professionals should consider educational interventions to minimise these risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

More than 40 years after its resurgence in Africa in 1970, cholera remains a grave public health problem, characterized by large disease burden, frequent outbreaks, persistent endemicity, and high CFRs, particularly in the region of the central African Great Lakes which might act as reservoirs for cholera. There, cases occur year round with a rise in incidence during the rainy season. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, cholera occurs mostly in outbreaks of varying size with a constant threat of widespread epidemics. Between 1970 and 2011, African countries reported 3,221,050 suspected cholera cases to the World Health Organization, representing 46 % of all cases reported globally. Excluding the Haitian epidemic, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 86 % of reported cases and 99 % of deaths worldwide in 2011. The number of cholera cases is possibly much higher than what is reported to the WHO due to the variation in modalities, completeness, and case definition of national cholera data. One source on country specific incidence rates for Africa, adjusting for underreporting, estimates 1,341,080 cases and 160,930 deaths (52.6 % of 2,548,227 estimated cases and 79.6 % of 209,216 estimated deaths worldwide). Another estimates 1,411,453 cases and 53,632 deaths per year, respectively (50 % of 2,836,669 estimated cases and 58.6 % of 91,490 estimated deaths worldwide). Within Africa, half of all cases between 1970 and 2011 were notified from only seven countries: Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, and South Africa. In contrast to a global trend of decreasing case fatality ratios (CFRs), CFRs have remained stable in Africa at approximately 2 %. Early propagation of cholera outbreaks depends largely on the extent of individual bacterial shedding, host and organism characteristics, the likelihood of people coming into contact with an infectious dose of Vibrio cholerae and on the virulence of the implicated strain. Cholera transmission can then be amplified by several factors including contamination of human water- or food sources; climate and extreme weather events; political and economic crises; high population density combined with poor quality informal housing and poor hygiene practices; spread beyond a local community through human travel and animals, e.g., water birds. At an individual level, cholera risk may increase with decreasing immunity and hypochlorhydria, such as that induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, which is endemic in much of Africa, and may increase individual susceptibility and cholera incidence. Since contaminated water is the main vehicle for the spread of cholera, the obvious longterm solution to eradicate the disease is the provision of safe water to all African populations. This requires considerable human and financial resources and time. In the short and medium term, vaccination may help to prevent and control the spread of cholera outbreaks. Regardless of the intervention, further understanding of cholera biology and epidemiology is essential to identify populations and areas at increased risk and thus ensure the most efficient use of scarce resources for the prevention and control of cholera."

Cats are the natural reservoir for Bartonella henselae, which is a (re-)emerging bacterial pathogen. It can cause cat scratch disease in humans and, in immunocompromised people, may lead to severe systemic diseases, such as bacillary angiomatosis. Cats bacteraemic with B henselae constitute the main reservoir from which humans become infected. Most cats naturally infected with B henselae show no clinical signs themselves, but other Bartonella species for which cats are accidental hosts appear to have more pathogenicity. Global importance: Several studies have reported a prevalence of previous or current Bartonella species infection in cats of up to 36%. B henselae is common in cats worldwide, and bacteraemia can be documented by blood culture in about a quarter of healthy cats. The distribution of B henselae to various parts of the world has largely occurred through humans migrating with their pet cats. The pathogen is mainly transmitted from cat to cat by fleas, and the majority of infected cats derive from areas with high flea exposure. No significant difference in B henselae prevalence has been determined between male and female cats. In studies on both naturally and experimentally infected cats, chronic bacteraemia has mainly been found in cats under the age of 2 years, while those over 2 years of age are rarely chronically bacteraemic. Evidence base: This article reviews published studies and case reports on bartonellosis to explore the clinical significance of the infection in cats and its impact on humans. The article also discusses possible treatment options for cats and means of minimising the zoonotic potential."

Climate change may also affect socio-economic aspects related to food systems such as agriculture, animal production, global trade, demographics and human behaviour which all influence food safety. This paper reviews the potential impacts of predicted changes in climate on food contamination and food safety at various stages of the food chain and identifies adaptation strategies and research priorities to address food safety implications of climate change.

A complicated and perhaps underestimated threat is how climate change may affect foodborne parasites a subject that tends to be neglected among infectious diseases under any climatic conditions. Here we review some selected examples of these pathogens, and how they may interact and alter with the changing environment: the complexity and variation in their lifecycles mean that different parasites will not necessarily be affected similarly by the same climate changes. To provide illustrative examples we have chosen a couple of parasites from each major group: trematodes, cestodes, nematodes, and protozoans. Even within these groups, different members utilize widely varying routes to complete their lifecycles, exploring new areas together with their hosts, floating from one place to another, or travelling along with their hosts to white spots on their maps. These parasites are very different from each other, but all are influenced by abiotic factors and have a common goal, to reach their next host. This review aims to open the readers mind to how exposure routes and transmission routes may be affected by climate change: realization of the possibilities is the first step towards closing the door to the parasites that are knocking at it.

Warmer temperatures are expected to increase disease risks from food-borne pathogens, water-borne diseases, and vector-borne zoonoses in human and animal populations of Arctic landscapes. Existing high levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutant chemicals circulating within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Arctic latitudes are a major concern for the reproductive health of humans and other mammals, and climate warming will accelerate the mobilization and biological amplification of toxic environmental contaminants. The adverse health impacts of Arctic warming will be especially important for wildlife populations and indigenous peoples dependent upon subsistence food resources from wild plants and animals. Additional research is needed to identify and monitor changes in the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in humans, domestic dogs, and wildlife species of critical subsistence, cultural, and economic importance to Arctic peoples. The long-term effects of climate warming in the Arctic cannot be adequately predicted or mitigated without a comprehensive understanding of the interactive and synergistic effects between environmental contaminants and pathogens in the health of wildlife and human communities in Arctic ecosystems.

With global climate change, extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods are expected to occur with increasing frequency and greater intensity and may potentially result in an upsurge in the disease incidence as well as the magnitude of leptospirosis outbreaks. In this paper, we examine mechanisms by which climate change can affect various ecological factors that are likely to drive an increase in the overall incidence as well as the frequency of outbreaks of leptospirosis. We will discuss the geographical areas that are most likely to be at risk of an increase in leptospirosis disease burden owing to the coexistence of climate change hazard risk, environmental drivers of leptospirosis outbreaks, local socioeconomic circumstances, and social and demographic trends. To reduce this disease burden, enhanced surveillance and further research is required to understand the environmental drivers of infection, to build capacity in emergency response and to promote community adaptation to a changing climate.

Usually, these infections are caused by Enterobacter or microorganisms from the urogenital inferior system, such as Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Escherichia coli, Proteus spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella, etc. In some cases, vaginitis may be caused by primary infections with Brucella canis, which is zoonotic, or by canine herpesvirus; both of these agents have the potential to cause reproductive failure. The disease can occur in any age, breed or ovarian condition and can be identified by vaginal cytology, vaginoscopy and culture of vaginal secretions. The most common clinical signs are erythema of the vaginal mucous, vaginal discharge, pollakiuria, licking of the vulva and attraction of male dogs, independent of the phase of the estrous cycle.

Given the potential for zoonotic transmission, euthanasia of affected dogs is recommended, but this action is not mandatory. We report the clinical management of three dogs that underwent treatment at their owners' request. Case reports A 14-month-old spayed female crossbreed originally obtained from an urban animal shelter underwent extensive investigations in 2011-12 for lameness and back pain, culminating in decompressive laminectomy. Diagnosis of multifocal discospondylitis and spinal empyema was made, with B. suis cultured from surgical biopsy specimens. The dog responded to long-term treatment using rifampicin and doxycycline. A second case of B. suis infection was diagnosed in January 2016 in a 3-year-old crossbreed pig-hunting dog with unilateral testicular enlargement. Following serological diagnosis the dog was given preliminary therapy using rifampicin and doxycycline, the affected testis was resected and the patient given a further month of combination therapy. In March 2016 a 7-year-old crossbreed pig-hunting dog with brucellosis was handled similarly, although both testes were removed. Conclusion Brucellosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of back pain, discospondylitis, lameness, abortion, prostatic abscessation and testicular/epididymal enlargement in dogs, especially if there is exposure to feral pigs or consumption of uncooked feral pig meat. Euthanasia is the only guarantee of reducing the public health risk to zero. However, where treatment is desired by the owner, combination therapy using rifampicin and doxycycline appears to be effective, when combined with surgical resection of infected tissues.

Three major factors have raised concern about the potential for this pathogen to be a cause of foodborne disease: the increasing recognition of community-associated C. difficile infection, recent studies identifying C. difficile in food animals and food, and similarities in C. difficile isolates from animals, food and humans. It is clear that C. difficile can be commonly found in food animals and food in many regions, and that strains important in human infections, such as ribotype 027/NAP1/toxinotype III and ribotype 078/toxinotype V, are often present. However, it is currently unclear whether ingestion of contaminated food can result in colonization or infection. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the role of C. difficile in community-associated diarrhoea: its source when it is a food contaminant, the infective dose, and the association between ingestion of contaminated food and disease. The significant role of this pathogen in human disease and its potential emergence as an important community-associated pathogen indicate that careful evaluation of different sources of exposure, including food, is required, but determination of the potential role of food in C. difficile infection may be difficult."

It has been found in both diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal pigs, horses and cattle, suggesting a potential reservoir for human insection, and in 20-40 % of meat products in Canada and the USA, suggesting the possibility, albeit not proven, of food-borne transmission. Although it is not yet completely clear, it is likely that excessive antimicrobial exposure is driving the establishment of C. difficile in animals, in a manner analogous to human infection, rather than the organism just being normal flora of the animal gastrointestinal tract. PCR ribotype 078 is the most common ribotype of C. difficile found in pigs (83 % in one study in the USA) and cattle (up to 100 %) and this ribotype is now the third most common ribotype of C. difficile found in human infection in Europe. Human and pig strains of C. difficile are genetically identical in Europe confirming that a zoonosis exists. Rates of community-acquired C. difficile infection (CDI) are increasing world wide, a fact that sits well with the notion that animals are a reservoir for human infection. Thus, there are three problems that require resolution: a human health issue, an animal health issue and the factor common to both these problems, environmental contamination.

Neurocysticercosis, the most serious form of the disease, is considered the most common parasitic infection of the human nervous system and the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy in the developing world. Although theoretically easy to control and declared eradicable, T. solium taeniosis/cysticercosis remains a neglected disease. There is a lack of information and awareness of the burden and transmission of the disease at the regional and global level, partially explained by the unavailability of good quality diagnostic tools in field-applicable formats. These factors are further compounded by a lack of validated simple and sustainable intervention packages as part of integrated helminth control programmes. To date, T. solium taeniosis/cysticercosis has not been eliminated from any region by a specific programme in Southeast Asia, and no national control programmes are yet in place except in parts of the People's Republic of China.

Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (similar to 95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F-ST, differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without reinvasion."
3649,Joy,NO,NA,"Pesavento, PA; Murphy, BG",common and emerging infectious diseases in the animal shelter,2014,VETERINARY PATHOLOGY,Web of Science,"The beneficial role that animal shelters play is unquestionable. An estimated 3 to 4 million animals are cared for or placed in homes each year, and most shelters promote public health and support responsible pet ownership. It is, nonetheless, inevitable that shelters are prime examples of anthropogenic biological instability: even well-run shelters often house transient, displaced, and mixed populations of animals. Many of these animals have received minimal to no prior health care, and some have a history of scavenging or predation to survive. Overcrowding and poor shelter conditions further magnify these inherent risks to create individual, intraspecies, and interspecies stress and provide an environment conducive to exposure to numerous potentially collaborative pathogens. All of these factors can contribute to the evolution and emergence of new pathogens or to alterations in virulence of endemic pathogens. While it is not possible to effectively anticipate the timing or the pathogen type in emergence events, their sites of origin are less enigmatic, and pathologists and diagnosticians who work with sheltered animal populations have recognized several such events in the past decade. This article first considers the contribution of the shelter environment to canine and feline disease. This is followed by summaries of recent research on the pathogenesis of common shelter pathogens, as well as research that has led to the discovery of novel or emerging diseases and the methods that are used for their diagnosis and discovery. For the infectious agents that commonly affect sheltered dogs and cats, including canine distemper virus, canine influenza virus, Streptococcus spp, parvoviruses, feline herpesvirus, feline caliciviruses, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, we present familiar as well as newly recognized lesions associated with infection. Preliminary studies on recently discovered viruses like canine circovirus, canine bocavirus, and feline norovirus indicate that these pathogens can cause or contribute to canine and feline disease."

Physicians in other fields of medicine are largely unaware of the value of a comparative and evolutionary approach. Demonstrations of how comparative approaches can increase insights into human medical issues in non-infectious disease fields will help advance collaboration between a wider range of physicians and veterinarians. The power of a comparative and evolutionary approach to spark unique hypotheses is provided from the field of cardiovascular medicine. A common cardiovascular condition affecting people, vasovagal syncope (VVS), has non-human animal correlates and roots. Comparative analysis of VVS reveals insights into how and why this autonomic response occurs.

Appropriate anti-rickettsial treatment ensures a successful recovery. Doxycycline is a recommended drug, but it is contraindicated in pregnant women and young children. Azithromycin is a safer alternative drug, but its effectiveness remains largely unclear. Herein, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of azithromycin. Methods: Studies that investigated azithromycin in treating scrub typhus were systematically identified from electronic databases up to December 2016. Information regarding study population, disease severity, treatment protocols, and responses was extracted and analyzed. Results: In this review, 5 studies were included, which comprised a total of 427 patients. When comparing the treatment failure rate, we observed a favorable outcome in patients treated with azithromycin (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-2.98). However, patients in the azithromycin group had longer time to defervescence (mean difference 4.38 hours, 95% CI - 2.51 to 11.27) and higher rate of fever for more than 48hours (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.81-2.12). Moreover, patients treated with azithromycin had less adverse effects (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.42-1.52). Conclusions: Azithromycin is as effective as other anti-rickettsial drugs with higher treatment success rates, lower frequency of adverse effects, and longer time to defervescence (GRADE 2B). Therefore, it is reasonable to use azithromycin as the first-line treatment against scrub typhus. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the effectiveness of azithromycin in specific patient groups, at high dose and influence of drug resistance."

Despite the implementation of comprehensive animal surveillance programs, many mycobacterial diseases have remained recalcitrant to eradication in several industrialized countries. Two major mycobacterial pathogens of cattle are Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), the causative agents of bovine tuberculosis (BIB) and Johne's disease (JD), respectively. BIB is a chronic, granulomatous disease of the respiratory tract that is spread via aerosol transmission, while JD is a chronic granulomatous disease of the intestines that is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Although these diseases exhibit differential tissue tropism and distinct complex etiologies, both M. bovis and MAP infect, reside, and replicate in host macrophages - the key host innate immune cell that encounters mycobacterial pathogens after initial exposure and mediates the subsequent immune response. The persistence of M. bovis and MAP in macrophages relies on a diverse series of immunomodulatory mechanisms, including the inhibition of phagosome maturation and apoptosis, generation of cytokine-induced necrosis enabling dissemination of infection through the host, local pathology, and ultimately shedding of the pathogen. Here, we review the bovine macrophage response to infection with M. bovis and MAP In particular, we describe how recent advances in functional genomics are shedding light on the host macrophage pathogen interactions that underlie different mycobacterial diseases. To illustrate this, we present new analyses of previously published bovine macrophage transcriptomics data following in vitro infection with virulent M. bows, the attenuated vaccine strain M. bovis BCG, and MAP and discuss our findings with respect to the differing etiologies of BIB and JD."

Policy is based on a simplistic theory of HIV causation, and evaluated using outdated tools of health economics. Recent calls for a health systems strategy - preventing and treating HIV within a programme of comprehensive health care - have not yet influenced the silo approach of AIDS policy. Evidence continues to accumulate, showing that multiple factors, such as malnutrition, malaria and helminthes, increase the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV. Moreover, complementary interventions that reduce viral load, improve immune response, and interrupt pathways of transmission could increase the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs and other tools of AIDS policy. In health economics, the omission of estimates of increasing returns generated by disease or treatment synergies biases cost-effectiveness analysis against multiple, yet inexpensive, interventions. Current tools of cost-effectiveness analysis only identify local maxima in a complex landscape, and can play, at best, a marginal role in the epidemic, especially where it is already generalized. Cost-effectiveness analyses for HIV that are based on the wrong epidemiological model can generate Type III errors: we get precise answers to the wrong questions about how to intervene. To control the epidemic, AIDS policy needs to utilize an epidemiological model that reflects the interactions of biological as well as behavioural variables that determine the course of HIV epidemics around the world. Cost-effectiveness analysis can benefit from using economic concepts of externalities and increasing returns to incorporate disease interactions and beneficial treatment spillovers for coinfections in HIV-prevention policy."

The information revealed that the current legislative framework in Grenada does not adequately address poultry food safety and that there is a need to strengthen the synergies between the agricultural and health sectors to enable a more thorough monitoring of antimicrobials use in poultry production. There is a need to strengthen epidemiology of zoonotic diseases, provisioning of education and information for key stakeholders about the use of antibiotics and the development of a system to monitor antibiotic procurement, distribution and use in Grenada.

However, other species are known to cause infection, for example, Legionella longbeachae causes an equivalent number of cases of disease as L. pneumophila in Australia and New Zealand. Infection with L. longbeachae is commonly associated with exposure to composts and potting soils, and cases of infection with this organism have been increasing in Europe over the past tenyears. The increase in incidence may be linked to factors such as increased awareness of clinical presentation, or due to changing formulation of growing media, although it should be noted that the presence of Legionella species in growing media does not correlate with the number of cases currently seen. This is likely due to the variables associated with infection, for example, host factors such as smoking or underlying health conditions, or difference in growing media storage or climate, especially warm humid conditions, which may affect survival and growth of these organisms in the growing media environment. There are numerous unknowns in this area and collaboration between growing media manufacturers and researchers, as well as more awareness among diagnosing clinicians, laboratory staff and the general public is necessary to reduce risk. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn: L. pneumophila research currently dominates the field and it is likely that the overreliance on diagnostic techniques such as the urinary antigen test, which is specific for L. pneumophila Sg 1, is detrimental to the diagnosis of L. longbeachae infection."

However, human and financial resources available to support government veterinary services are becoming more and more limited in many countries world-wide. Intuitively, issues that present higher risks merit higher priority for surveillance resources as investments will yield higher benefit-cost ratios. The rapid rate of acceptance of this core concept of risk-based surveillance has outpaced the development of its theoretical and practical bases. Discussion: The principal objectives of risk-based veterinary surveillance are to identify surveillance needs to protect the health of livestock and consumers, to set priorities, and to allocate resources effectively and efficiently. An important goal is to achieve a higher benefit-cost ratio with existing or reduced resources. We propose to define risk-based surveillance systems as those that apply risk assessment methods in different steps of traditional surveillance design for early detection and management of diseases or hazards. In risk-based designs, public health, economic and trade consequences of diseases play an important role in selection of diseases or hazards. Furthermore, certain strata of the population of interest have a higher probability to be sampled for detection of diseases or hazards. Evaluation of risk-based surveillance systems shall prove that the efficacy of risk-based systems is equal or higher than traditional systems; however, the efficiency ( benefit-cost ratio) shall be higher in risk-based surveillance systems. Summary: Risk-based surveillance considerations are useful to support both strategic and operational decision making. This article highlights applications of risk-based surveillance systems in the veterinary field including food safety. Examples are provided for risk-based hazard selection, risk-based selection of sampling strata as well as sample size calculation based on risk considerations."

The causative agent of rabies is rabies virus (RV), a negative-stranded RNA virus of the rhabdovirus family. Neuroinvasiveness and neurotropism are the main features that define the pathogenesis of rabies. Although RV pathogenicity is a multigenic trait involving several elements of the RV genome, the RV glycoprotein plays a major role in RV pathogenesis by controlling the rate of virus uptake and trans-synaptic virus spread, and by regulating the rate of virus replication. Pathogenic street RV strains differ significantly from tissue culture-adapted RV strains in their neuroinvasiveness. Whereas street RV strains are highly neuroinvasive, most tissue culture-adapted RV strains have either no or only limited ability to invade the CNS from a peripheral site. The high neuroinvasiveness of pathogenic street RVs is, at least in part, due to their ability to evade immune responses and to conserve the structures of neurons. The finding that tissue culture-adapted RV strains replicate very fast and induce strong innate and adaptive immune responses opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention against rabies."

Conflict is a complex system of clash or disagreement, often violent, between two opposing groups or individuals. Conflicts and wars have become a common place in the world, especially in Africa. So pervading are these conflicts and wars that African countries readily come to mind in any discourse on conflicts and wars any where in the world today. Infectious diseases continue to occur throughout the world, both sporadically and as outbreaks, because of multiple factors. Disease emergence is influenced by and environmental changes (e.g., agriculture, deforestation, droughts and floods), human demographics and behavior (e.g., population migration, urbanization, conflicts, international trade and travel), technology and industry, microbial adaptation and breakdown in public health measures. Conflict leaves populations in dire poverty, internally displaced or seeking asylum, having poor access to essential services and consequentially vulnerable to infectious diseases. Conflict situations present a multitude of risk factors that enhance disease emergence and transmission, over and above those in other resource-poor countries. The propensity for emerging infectious disease outbreaks to occur in conflict-affected countries and the need to monitor and respond more effectively to such events cannot be over-emphasized. Detection, containment and control of emerging infectious diseases in conflict situations are major challenges because of multiple risk factors that promote disease transmission and hinder control even more than those in many resource-poor settings. Beyond the global public health imperative to prevent the international spread of infectious diseases, there is also a moral imperative to alleviate the effects of these diseases on already vulnerable conflict-affected populations."

Dysregulation of adipose tissue lipolysis results in increased plasma free fatty acid concentrations, and via that mechanism contributes to insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adipose tissue hormone sensitive lipase is thought to be responsible for the production of the majority of free fatty acids. However, a separate contribution comes from the action of endothelial lipases, especially lipoprotein lipase, on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins via a process known as spillover. The primary substrate for spillover appears to be chylomicrons derived from dietary fat. The spillover of fatty acids into the free fatty acid pool varies from one tissue to another. For example, spillover is low (similar to 14%) in the forearm of healthy volunteers, suggesting that triglyceride fatty acid storage is relatively efficient in skeletal muscle. In contrast, spillover appears to be higher in adipose tissue and may also be higher in the splanchnic bed, based on preliminary data. If systemic spillover is increased in insulin resistant states such as diabetes, this could represent a mechanism contributing to the abnormal increases in plasma concentrations of free fatty acids in that condition."

Although there is no vaccine commercially available for any human parasitic infection yet, recent progress in vaccine development is making this a future possibility for several diseases. The goal of chemotherapy is to alleviate infection and morbidity in the definitive host, or reduce transmission, while the effect of available vaccine candidates would mainly be to influence transmission through targeting the intermediate or reservoir host, when the infection is zoonotic. Apart from this general scheme, there are also vaccine candidates targeting the parasites in the definitive host, in particular the early developmental stages, which should reduce the risk of drug failure. Since the biological targets in most cases are different, vaccination would be synergistic with drug therapy. This review covers diseases caused by helminthes in both humans and animals and includes examples of diseases caused by cestodes, nematodes and trematodes. The focus is on infections for which vaccine development has been undertaken for a long time, resulting in products that could realistically become integrated into control strategies in the near future."

In spite of achieving a low rate infection in Salmonella infections, this microbe has become a challenge in food industry due to its wide-spread distribution worldwide. Salmonella bacteria are not only responsible for mild to severe infections but also they cause life-threatening infections. Salmonella bacteria are zoonotic in nature and hamper the food quality severely as well as being hazardous to human society. Several types of serotypic Salmonella have been reported; however, very less numbers of pathogens are infection responsible. Increase in foodborne infections caused by Salmonella types mainly occurs due to the development of new specific features in Salmonella majority, making them to adapt in any environmental condition. Also the alterations in human society with recent food processing and marketing methodology with live breeders contribute to facilitate these outbreaks. Salmonella resistant to commercial antibiotic drugs has emerged as a great health concern to the consumers. Literature survey has revealed that infection with Salmonella resistant to antibiotics has played a vital role to increased rate in foodborne infectious diseases. Extensive use of antibiotics in food industry against foodborne pathogens or food models has resulted in additional antibiotic resistance to Salmonella which has become a matter of great concern to the public health. There has been an increasing concern worldwide on therapeutic values of natural products. Nature has presented to humanity the gift of vast therapeutic antimicrobial agents of plant origins. There are multitudes of potential useful bioactive substances to be derived from plants. The significance of drugs cannot be over-emphasized with the recent trend of high percentage of resistance of microorganisms to the present day antibiotics. This review provides the informative literature data on antibacterial efficacy of plant essential oils (PEOs) and their volatiles. In addition, the suitability of PEOs and their volatile components for their practical applications in food or food products against Salmonella, a common cause of salmonellosis food poisoning has also been focused. The current knowledge of volatile oils and contents in food model system to control Salmonella has been discussed. Also a brief description on the legal aspects on how to use the volatile oils in food system has been presented, and the area for future research has been proposed. A mode of antibacterial action of PEOs along with their chemical nature has also been described. Although some data on Salmonella-related issues are presented, this review chiefly focused on in vivo practical utilization of plant volatile oils and components in food model-system as natural anti-Salmonella agents.

Poultry meat contaminated by Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is an important source of this enteric zoonosis. Broiler chickens are the common natural host for this pathogen and infected birds carry a very high Campylobacter load in their gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, intervention at the farm level by reducing pathogen colonisation should be taken into consideration in any control policy. In addition, hygienic measures at the farm and control measures during carcass processing can reduce Campylobacter numbers on the retail product. It is important to differentiate between prevention and colonisation-reducing measures, which intervene at a different stage of the infection process. Several approaches have been conducted to reduce the number of Campylobacter in poultry, such as vaccination, passive immunisation, bacteriophages, bacteriocins, organic acids or their derivatives and medium chain of fatty acids, all with varying degrees of success. Nonetheless, to date there is no reliable and practical intervention measure available to reduce colonisation of the broiler gut with Campylobacter. A possible way to reduce Campylobacter contamination in poultry is to develop new strategies at the primary production level. As a consequence, it has become necessary to develop alternatives such as beneficial microorganisms (probiotics). The use of probiotics can help to improve the natural defence of animals against pathogenic bacteria and is an effective approach for livestock to reduce bacterial contamination. This review summarises current on-farm control options to reduce the prevalence and colonisation of Campylobacter in poultry. The interaction between poultry welfare and Campylobacter colonisation is also discussed."

Only few studies, however, have considered the differences between battery cages and alternative systems with regard to infectious diseases. The existing gaps in the current knowledge need to be closed by research and measures must be developed that will prevent the spread of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections in alternative poultry housing systems. With regard to virus infections, avian influenza requires particular attention. Since wild birds, particularly anseriformes, represent a reservoir for avian influenza viruses, free-ranging poultry is much more at risk of infection than birds in closed hen-houses. Appropriate measures must prevent direct contact with wild birds and transmission via contaminated water, feed, or equipment. Several bacterial infections of poultry represent zoonoses. Salmonella and Campylobacter are considered as particularly important. To avoid a potential increase in the risk of infection for consumers due to poultry keeping systems that might favour infections with bacterial zoonotic agents, there is a special need for research in this area. With regard to parasitic infections, coccidioses may cause problems in alternative poultry housing systems, and lead to considerable economic consequences. The epidemiological situation concerning infections with Histomonas meleagridis needs to be analysed. Since all compounds that had been used for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes in the past have been banned, there is a need to develop new drugs which are safe for animals and humans."

However, its health security is under increasing pressure due to a number of ecological, climatic, demographic and behavioural changes occurring globally. North Queensland is a high risk area (a health security hot spot) for Australia, due in part to its connection to neighbouring countries via the Torres Strait and the Indo-Papuan conduit, its high diversity of wildlife reservoirs and its environmental characteristics. Major outbreaks of exotic diseases, pests and weeds in Australia can cost in excess of $1 billion; however, most expenditure on health security is reactive apart from preventive measures undertaken for a few high profile diseases, pests and weeds. Large gains in health security could therefore be made by spending more on pre-emptive approaches to reduce the risk of outbreaks, invasion/spread and establishment, despite these gains being difficult to quantify. Although biosecurity threats may initially have regional impacts (e.g. Hendra virus), a break down in security in health security hot spots can have national and international consequences, as has been seen recently in other regions with the emergence of SARS and pandemic avian influenza. Novel approaches should be driven by building research and management capacity, particularly in the regions where threats arise, a model that is applicable both in Australia and in other regions of the world that value and therefore aim to improve their strategies for maintaining health security.

3677,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Faure, E",could fiv zoonosis responsible of the breakdown of the pathocenosis which has reduced the european ccr5-delta32 allele frequencies?,2008,VIROLOGY JOURNAL,Web of Science,"Background: In Europe, the north-south downhill cline frequency of the chemokine receptor CCR5 allele with a 32-bp deletion (CCR5-Delta 32) raises interesting questions for evolutionary biologists. We had suggested first that, in the past, the European colonizers, principally Romans, might have been instrumental of a progressively decrease of the frequencies southwards. Indeed, statistical analyses suggested strong negative correlations between the allele frequency and historical parameters including the colonization dates by Mediterranean civilisations. The gene flows from colonizers to native populations were extremely low but colonizers are responsible of the spread of several diseases suggesting that the dissemination of parasites in naive populations could have induced a breakdown rupture of the fragile pathocenosis changing the balance among diseases. The new equilibrium state has been reached through a negative selection of the null allele. Results: Most of the human diseases are zoonoses and cat might have been instrumental in the decrease of the allele frequency, because its diffusion through Europe was a gradual process, due principally to Romans; and that several cat zoonoses could be transmitted to man. The possible implication of a feline lentivirus (FIV) which does not use CCR5 as co-receptor is discussed. This virus can infect primate cells in vitro and induces clinical signs in macaque. Moreover, most of the historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-Delta 32 allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs. Conclusion: We proposed the hypothesis that the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading. A cat zoonosis, could be the most plausible hypothesis. Future studies could provide if CCR5 can play an antimicrobial role in FIV pathogenesis. Moreover, studies of ancient DNA could provide more evidences regarding the implications of zoonoses in the actual CCR5-Delta 32 distribution."

3680,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Gratz, NG",critical review of the vector status of aedes albopictus,2004,MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY,Web of Science,"The mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), originally indigenous to South-east Asia, islands of the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, has spread during recent decades to Africa, the mid-east, Europe and the Americas (north and south) after extending its range eastwards across Pacific islands during the early 20th century. The majority of introductions are apparently due to transportation of dormant eggs in tyres. Among public health authorities in the newly infested countries and those threatened with the introduction, there has been much concern that Ae. albopictus would lead to serious outbreaks of arbovirus diseases (Ae. albopictus is a competent vector for at least 22 arboviruses), notably dengue (all four serotypes) more commonly transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.). Results of many laboratory studies have shown that many arboviruses are readily transmitted by Ae. albopictus to laboratory animals and birds, and have frequently been isolated from wild-caught mosquitoes of this species, particularly in the Americas. As Ae. albopictus continues to spread, displacing Ae. aegypti in some areas, and is anthropophilic throughout its range, it is important to review the literature and attempt to predict whether the medical risks are as great as have been expressed in scientific journals and the popular press. Examination of the extensive literature indicates that Ae. albopictus probably serves as a maintenance vector of dengue in rural areas of dengue-endemic countries of South-east Asia and Pacific islands. Also Ae. albopictus transmits dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy) (Spirurida: Onchocercidae) in South-east Asia, south-eastern U.S.A. and both D. immitis and Dirofilaria repens (Raillet & Henry) in Italy. Despite the frequent isolation of dengue viruses from wild-caught mosquitoes, there is no evidence that Ae. albopictus is an important urban vector of dengue, except in a limited number of countries where Ae. aegypti is absent, i.e. parts of China, the Seychelles, historically in Japan and most recently in Hawaii. Further research is needed on the dynamics of the interaction between Ae. albopictus and other Stegomyia species. Surveillance must also be maintained on the vectorial role of Ae. albopictus in countries endemic for dengue and other arboviruses (e.g. Chikungunya, EEE, Ross River, WNV, LaCrosse and other California group viruses), for which it would be competent and ecologically suited to serve as a bridge vector."

However, a number of other nosological entities have a similar history, namely type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, asthma, psoriasis, spondylarthritis, Blau syndrom etc. The zoonotic risk of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) has been discussed for more than one hundred years., The problem remains open, further research is needed"", is the sentence which seems to be obligatory in the conclusions of many scientific articles. A number of hypotheses have been suggested, all with a grain of truth in them. The infection hypothesis has many supporters and opponents, but it does not fit to all Crohn's disease cases. The contribution of the genetic factor has been admitted a long time ago and has been experimentally confirmed by recent excellent studies. An environmental factor is expected and has been often mentioned, but has yet to be discovered. Muramyl dipeptide, derived from peptidoglycans of the bacterial cell wall is one of the triggers, mentioned in connection with chronic inflammatory diseases. The immunomodulatory ability of this compound has been recognised for decades and is exploited in Freund's adjuvant. A critical amount of muramyl dipeptide can affect immunity during some bacterial infections but the long latent period between infection and onset of the clinical form of the disease could explain why a causative relationship between the primary infection and chronic inflammation is not considered. Different species of mycobacteria can be found in the environment, in water, dust, soil and aerosol. Although severe infections with mycobacteria have been described, these species are not thought to be typical zoonotic pathogens. Muramyl dipeptide derived from mycobacteria obviously plays a starring role as a bacterial trigger in the aetiology of many autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Paratuberculosis in cattle and other ruminants is a source of enormous contamination of the environment but also of milk and meat by MAP. Muramyl dipeptide from mycobacteria, namely MAP, and Crohn's disease as a representative of diseases often called civilization threats, are important pieces of the gigantic puzzle. Mycobacteria in the environment and foodstuffs have to be acknowledged as a public health risk, which can never be completely eliminated. There is no reason to push the panic button, but we must learn how to live together with this microorganism, how the pool of immunomodulator sources can be diminished, and how the pathogenic relationship between triggers and target tissues can be disrupted. The dissemination of knowledge, the availability of rapid and inexpensive tools for identification of mycobacteria in different matrices, and the establishment of a maximal allowed limit for mycobacteria in milk and meat should contribute to food safety and consumer protection."

The significant morbidity and mortality in animals and humans caused by this disease as well as its considerable impact on the water industry have made its prevention and control a global challenge, particularly given that there are presently no widespread, affordable or effective treatment or vaccination strategies. Although much is known about Cryprosporidium and the impact of cryptosporidiosis and other diarrhoea! diseases in developed countries, this is not the case for many developing countries in Africa, South America and Asia. In Southeast Asia, which represents an epicentre for emerging infectious diseases, cryptosporidiosis has been reported in countries, such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. In most of these countries, the likely predisposing factors for cryptosporidiosis include rapid population growth and expanding urbanisation (which are often linked to inadequate municipal water supplies and poorly managed refuse disposal) as well as the tropical climate and the increasing prevalence of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Given the close proximity of these countries and the extent of migration within and among them, cryptosporidiosis can be difficult to control. National and regional surveillance is central to preventing and controlling cryptosporidiosis. To date, most studies of cryptosporidiosis in Southeast Asia have focus on estimating the prevalence of infection in humans and animals using conventional diagnostic techniques. Future investigations using reliable molecular tools should enable improved insights into the epidemiology, systematics and population genetics of Cryptosporidium in this region. An enhanced understanding of the transmission of cryptosporidial infections and the significance of environmental contamination will require a multidisciplinary approach. built on shared resources. Such an integrated approach would underpin stable and powerful partnerships in efforts to prevent and control this disease. The purpose of the present chapter is to review available data and information on cryptosporidiosis in Southeast Asia and to provide recommendations in the pursuit of a better understanding of Cryptosporidium in this region, in order to facilitate the development of effective multidisciplinary interventions to control cryptosporidiosis."

Due to the wide host range and environmental persistence of this parasite, cryptosporidiosis can be zoonotic and associated with foodborne and waterborne outbreaks. Currently, 31 species are recognized as valid, and of these, Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are responsible for the majority of infections in humans. The immune status of the host, both innate and adaptive immunity, has a major impact on the severity of the disease and its prognosis. Immunocompetent individuals typically experience self-limiting diarrhoea and transient gastroenteritis lasting up to 2weeks and recover without treatment, suggesting an efficient host antiparasite immune response. Immunocompromised individuals can suffer from intractable diarrhoea, which can be fatal. Effective drug treatments and vaccines are not yet available. As a result of this, the close cooperation and interaction between veterinarians, health physicians, environmental managers and public health operators is essential to properly control this disease. This review focuses on a One Health approach to prophylaxis, including the importance of understanding transmission routes for zoonotic Cryptosporidium species, improved sanitation and better risk management, improved detection, diagnosis and treatment and the prospect of an effective anticryptosporidial vaccine."

This review considers the potential for this phenomenon to impact on human health in Europe, by examining evidence of the role of Culicoides biting midges in the zoonotic transmission and person-to-person spread of arboviruses worldwide. To date, the only arbovirus identified as being primarily transmitted by Culicoides to and between humans is Oropouche virus (OROV). This member of the genus Orthobunyavirus causes major epidemics of febrile illness in human populations of South and Central America and the Caribbean. We examine factors promoting sustained outbreaks of OROV in Brazil from an entomological perspective and assess aspects of the epidemiology of this arbovirus that are currently poorly understood, but may influence the risk of incursion into Europe. We then review the secondary and rarely reported role of Culicoides in the transmission of high-profile zoonotic infections, while critically reviewing evidence of this phenomenon in endemic transmission and place this in context with the presence of other potential vector groups in Europe. Scenarios for the incursions of Culicoides-borne human-to-human transmitted and zoonotic arboviruses are then discussed, along with control measures that could be employed to reduce their impact. These measures are placed in the context of legislative measures used during current and ongoing outbreaks of Culicoides-borne arboviruses in Europe, involving both veterinary and public health sectors.

Despite the potentially significant health risks posed by pig production regarding pig-associated zoonoses, information on the sociocultural drivers of these zoonoses is significantly lacking. This review summarises the existing sociocultural knowledge on eight pig-associated zoonoses suspected to be endemic in Southeast Asia: brucellosis, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), trichinellosis, hepatitis E virus, leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis, Streptococcus suis and Taenia solium taeniasis-cysticercosis. It summarises current knowledge on these diseases grouped according to their clinical manifestations in humans to highlight the propensity for underreporting. A literature search was conducted across multiple databases for publications from 1990 to the present day related to the eight pig-associated zoonoses and the risk and impact connected with them, with Lao PDR as a case study. Many of these pig-associated zoonoses have similar presentations and are often diagnosed as clinical syndromes. Misdiagnosis and underreporting are, therefore, substantial and emphasise the need for more robust diagnostics and appropriate surveillance systems. While some reports exist in other countries in the region, information is significantly lacking in Lao PDR with existing information coming mainly from the capital, Vientiane. The disease burden imposed by these zoonoses is not only characterised by morbidity and mortality, but directly impacts on livelihoods through income reduction and production losses, and indirectly through treatment costs and lost work opportunities. Other factors crucial to understanding and controlling these diseases are the influence of ethnicity and culture on food-consumption practices, pig rearing and slaughter practices, hygiene and sanitation, health-seeking behaviours and, therefore, risk factors for disease transmission. Published information on the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of people regarding pig zoonoses and their risk factors is also extremely limited in Lao PDR and the broader Southeast Asian region. The need for more transdisciplinary research, using a One Health approach, in order to understand the underlining social determinants of health and their impacts on health-seeking behaviours, disease transmission and, ultimately, disease reporting, cannot be more emphasized."

This is likely due to the nature of their habitats as many species of fish suffer from living beneath turbid water away from easy recording. However, fishes represent key ecosystem services for millions of people around the world and the absence of a functional ecological understanding of viruses, prokaryotes, and small eukaryotes in the maintenance of fish populations and of their diversity represents an inherent barrier to aquatic conservation and food security. Among recent emerging infectious diseases responsible for severe population declines in plant and animal taxa, fungal and fungal-like microbes have emerged as significant contributors. Here, we review the current knowledge gaps of fungal and fungal-like parasites and pathogens in fish and put them into an ecological perspective with direct implications for the monitoring of fungal fish pathogens in the wild, their phylogeography as well as their associated ecological impact on fish populations. With increasing fish movement around the world for farming, releases into the wild for sport fishing and human-driven habitat changes, it is expected along with improved environmental monitoring of fungal and fungal-like infections, that the full extent of the impact of these pathogens on wild fish populations will soon emerge as a major threat to freshwater biodiversity."

Solid evidence exists for an increased risk for individuals living in close contact with leprosy patients, but the existence of zoonotic leprosy, environmental reservoirs and trauma-related transmission has also been established. Purpose: To assess the current state of knowledge on M. leprae transmission, we conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature pertaining to this topic. Method: Major electronic bibliographic databases were searched for relevant peer-reviewed articles published up to January 2014. No restrictions on study types, participants and location were applied, and all outcomes demonstrated to contribute to the transmission of M. leprae were considered. Included studies were grouped by mode of transmission, namely (i) human-to-human via aerosols or direct contact; (ii) direct inoculation (e.g. injury); and (iii) transmission to humans from environmental or zoonotic reservoirs, and by insects. The importance of the different transmission pathways and the strength of the evidence were assessed considering the number of publications describing similar findings, the consistency of the findings and the methodological quality of the studies. Results: A total of 79 relevant articles were retained out of 3,805 hits resulting from the application of the search strategy. Solid evidence for transmission among contacts exists, and for zoonotic leprosy in the southern States of the USA. Based on the extant evidence, skin-to-skin contact, aerosols/droplets and shedding of bacteria into the environment and subsequent infection, e.g. through dust or small wounds, all remain possible options.

Contributing factors to this phenomenon include heightened global connectivity via air travel and international trade links, as well as man-made environmental alterations, such as deforestation and climate change, which all serve to bring humans into closer contact with animal reservoirs and alter the habitat of vectors, thus facilitating the transmission of viruses between species. Serological assays are integral to tracking the epidemiological spread of a virus and evaluating mass vaccination programs by quantifying neutralizing antibody responses raised against antigenic epitopes on the viral surface. However, conventional serological tests are somewhat marred by equipment and reagent costs, the necessity for high-containment laboratories for studying many emerging viruses, and interlaboratory variability, among other issues. This review details next-generation' assays aimed at addressing some of the persistent problems with viral serology, focusing on how manipulating the genomes of RNA viruses can produce attenuated or chimeric viruses that can be exploited as surrogate viruses in neutralization assays. Despite the undoubted promise of such novel serological platforms, it must be remembered that these assays have to withstand rigorous validation and standardization measures before they can play an integral role in curtailing the severity of future emerging virus outbreaks."

It is a nonsystematic eruptive skin disease having public health importance. The disease is also known as sore mouth, contagious pustular dermatitis or scabby mouth. It is usually more severe in goats than in sheep and characterized by proliferative lesions on the mouth and muzzle usually resolved in 1-2 months. Other important members of the genus are pseudocowpox virus and bovine papular stomatitis virus. Although clinical signs are indicative of the orf disease, a laboratory based diagnosis is necessary for confirmation and epidemiological investigations. The lesions of the disease often jeopardize the optimum productivity and reduce the market value of the meat, leather and wool besides disruption of the national and international trade of animal and animal products. Further, the zoonotic importance of the disease has added the significance of the disease to a new dimension. Detailed and updated information on isolation, identification, physico-chemical properties, host range, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical signs, pathology, diagnosis, treatment, immunity and prophylaxis in goats and humans would not only help in updating the knowledge of scientific fraternity but also would be useful to the policy makers in order to formulate appropriate measures for control and eradication of the disease. This review is aimed to present the latest information on the disease to the readers that in turn help in the effective and efficient management of the disease leading the reduction of the economic losses to a great extent.

The Trematoda class contains a great number of species that infect humans and are recognized as the causative agents of disease. The biological cycle, geographical distribution, and epidemiology of most of these trematode species have been well characterized. Traditionally, these infections were limited, for the most part, in populations living in low-income countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, and were associated with poverty. However, the geographical limits and the population at risk are currently expanding and changing in relation to factors such as growing international markets, improved transportation systems, and demographic changes. The diagnosis of these diseases is based on parasitological techniques and only a limited number of drugs are currently available for treatment, most of which are unspecific. Therefore, in-depth studies are urgently needed in order to clarify the current epidemiology of these helminth infections and to identify new and specific targets for both effective diagnosis and treatment.

Approximately 2% of acute viral hepatitis is caused by HEV, and 18 cases of hepatitis E have been reported in Korea. Of these cases, only two have involved a history of travel from India, which suggests that they were imported cases. The remaining reported cases include a sporadic case of acute hepatitis E with genotype 4 HEV isolates and identification of the full genome sequence, as well as another case of genotype 4 HEV hepatitis that developed after ingestion of the raw bile juice of a wild bear living on a mountain in southern Korea. Moreover, genotype 3 HEV, which shows close genetic homology with swine HEV in Korea, has been detected in collected human serum samples. Therefore, genotypes 3 and 4 HEV are currently circulating in the Korean community and may be related to zoonotic transmission and food-borne infection. The reported anti-HEV seroprevalence of 17% to 27% in the Korean population suggests that HEV infection has been autochthonously circulating, thereby resulting in subclinical infection in Korea. Given the discrepancies among anti-HEV assays, the diagnosis of hepatitis E should be made with caution using adequate antibody assays, and HEV RNA should be preferably detected from the stool. Further virological characterization and epidemiological study of the virus are warranted. (Gut Liver 201145:427-431)"

Sporadic anthrax is still present world-wide, particularly in animal raising countries including Turkey. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings and treatment protocols of adult patients with cutaneous anthrax retrospectively. Material and Methods: A retrospective review of 39 adult patients with cutaneous anthrax presented between 1983 and 2005, in Cumhuriyet University Hospital in Sivas, a city located in the central Anatolia region of Turkey was carried out. Results: Of the 39 cases with the diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax, 27 (69.2%) were males and 12 (30.8%) were females. The mean age was 44 (range, 1674) years. The clinical presentations were severe edema due to anthrax in 10 (26%) and typical pustuler lesion in 29 (74%) patients. The lesions were mostly located on the hand and forearm. Twenty-five cases (64.1%) had a history of recent animal slaughtering activity. Culturing of 39 wound specimens yielded 17 (43.6%) B. anthracis strains. Thirty-six (92.3%) patients were treated with penicillin G. A patient with severe cutaneous anthrax and extensive edema died on the first admission day. Mortality rate was 2.6%. Conclusion: Although the incidence of anthrax is decreasing world-wide, it is still encountered in Turkey. Preventive measures such as education of the risk population and vaccinaton of animals against anthrax would reduce the incidence of the disease. We suppose that penicillin is still the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of cutaneous anthrax in endemic regions."

Some limitations of this procedure include reluctance to be immunized because of fear of needlesticks, and concerns associated with the safe disposal of needles after their use. Skin delivery is an alternate route of vaccination that has potential to be painless and could even lead to dose reduction of vaccines. Recently, microneedles have emerged as a novel painless approach for delivery of influenza vaccines via the skin. Areas covered: In this review, we briefly summarize the approaches and devices used for skin vaccination, and then focus on studies of skin immunization with influenza vaccines using microneedles. We discuss both the functional immune response and the nature of this immune response following vaccination with microneedles. Expert opinion: The cutaneous administration of influenza vaccines using microneedles offers several advantages: it is painless, elicits stronger immune responses in preclinical studies and could improve responses in high-risk populations. These dry formulations of vaccines provide enhanced stability, a property of high importance in enabling their rapid global distribution in response to possible outbreaks of pandemic influenza and newly emerging infectious diseases."

Cystic echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is one of the most important parasitic zoonoses occurring globally. In many regions of the world, the disease is an important epidemiological problem. The life cycle of Echinococcus involves hoofed farm animals and dogs. Among its species and genotypes ascertained in the world, two (G1 and G7) have been confirmed in sheep and pigs as intermediate hosts in Poland. Molecular examinations of postoperative parasitic material from patients established that the porcine strain G7 is the cause of human cystic echinococcosis in Poland. Data on post-slaughter examinations of pigs identified as intermediate hosts of E. granulosus suggest that the number of cases reported in humans (approx. 40 annually) is probably underestimated. In the last two years, the prevalence of hydatid cysts in pigs in Poland has been estimated at 0.3%, with the highest number of infected animals in central Poland (0.4%-1.2%).

A new model of investigation requires a dynamic shift of perspectives in the ""simplicity-complexity"" dimension: from virulence factors to multi-sided descriptions of the pathogens; from particular microbes to wide microbial communities; from clinical manifestations to a variety of infectious patterns; from findings of infectious agents to defining a natural focus of the infection as a self-regulated system; from single factors affecting host-parasite relations to the complex ecological context.

Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are a widely distributed rodent throughout most of South America, but are restricted to areas of standing water. As the Gran Chaco ecosystem of Paraguay is converted from dry tropical forest to pastureland, we hypothesize that this alteration creates potential for invasion by capybara into newly fragmented areas. We surveyed throughout the Chaco to estimate the distribution of capybara, and we collected noninvasive genetic samples. We used ecological niche modeling based on six environmental or climatic variables, and we modeled both the current distribution of capybara and the distribution of capybara 80 years ago. We then verified the hypothesized demographic signal generated with our model using phylogeographic analyses of 386 bp of the mtDNA control region. Comparison of present and past models suggested that populations expanded into the Gran Chaco after forest was converted to pastureland. Analyses of the mitochondrial D-loop supported the rapid range expansion scenario. We also found evidence of secondary contact of two distinct phylogroups which had previously been disjunct. Anthropogenic land transformation appeared to be a major factor influencing the distribution, as predicted by the niche model and confirmed by genetic data. Habitat modification altered connectivity of populations across the landscape. In addition, long separated clades of capybara are now admixed throughout the Paraguayan Chaco. The invasion of a large bodied herbivore into the High Chaco region may exacerbate the degradation of forest and prevent forest regeneration. As the reservoir host of several zoonotic diseases, the expansion and contact of two previously disjunct capybara populations has implications for disease emergence."

For example, DD underpins the idea of additive versus compensatory mortality and is a tenet in the paradigm of resource limitation and regulation. Yet the prevalence and importance of DD remains disputed in most organisms, including ducks, which are focal in game management, conservation and zoonotic diseases. Based on 154 data entries from 54 studies in the peer-reviewed literature, we here synthesize and evaluate the prevalence of DD in breeding ducks in relation to (1) species and guild (dabbling versus diving ducks), (2) stage in the breeding cycle (nesting, duckling, recruitment) or, alternatively, in terms of population dynamics, (3) study type (descriptive/non-manipulative versus experimental), (4) continent (Europe versus North America), (5) spatial level (wetland, landscape, regional, continental) and (6) biome (tundra, boreal, nemoral, prairie, mediterranean). One conclusion from this review is that it is difficult to find general patterns about the prevalence of DD unless data are broken down to subsets, for example, to stage or spatial level. With respect to stage, DD effects occur at all stages of the breeding cycle. During the nesting and duckling stages, the frequency of cases detecting versus not detecting DD is roughly the same. However, in cases referring to the recruitment stage, i.e. to survival of fledged ducks until 1 year old at the most, DD was the rule, suggesting that DD processes may operate mainly outside the breeding season. Further subdivision of data shows that spatial scale is important to the prevalence of DD in nesting ducks-rare on the wetland level and more common on higher spatial levels. In studies of population dynamics (i.e. based on time series data only), DD was more often found in diving than in dabbling ducks. This corroborates previous suggestions that dabbling ducks largely should be considered as r-selected species, in contrast to more K-selected diving ducks, which start to reproduce at an older age and often breed in more stable wetland environments where resources may be easier to track and populations thus often are closer to carrying capacity. However, the picture of DD in ducks is far from complete, and knowledge gaps for future studies to address include: (a) data from Russia, which holds a large part of the breeding ducks in the Northern hemisphere, (b) experimental studies on more species to separate density-dependent factors from other drivers of population change and to tease apart spatial and temporal interactions in the underlying processes, (c) time series analyses addressing population dynamics, especially from outside North America, (d) studies relating duck numbers to limiting resources, which arguably is the most relevant measure of density, (e) the timing of DD processes in relation to harvest and natural mortality."

In the past decade, the demand for rapid and accurate on-site detection of plant disease diagnosis has increased due to emerging pathogens with resistance to pesticides, increased human mobility, and regulations limiting the application of toxic chemicals to prevent spread of diseases. The portability of biosensors for on-site diagnosis is limited due to various issues, including sample preparation techniques, fluid-handling techniques, the limited lifetime of biological reagents, device packaging, integrating electronics for data collection/analysis, and the requirement of external accessories and power. Many microfluidic, electronic, and biological design strategies, such as handling liquids in biosensors without pumps/valves, the application of droplet-based microfluidics, paper-based microfluidic devices, and wireless networking capabilities for data transmission, are being explored."

The recent years have witnessed an increasing number of novel infectious diseases. The numerous examples of infections which originated from animals suggest that the zoonotic pool is an important and potentially rich source of emerging diseases. Since emergence and re-emergence of pathogens, and particularly zoonotic agents, occur at unpredictable rates in animal and human populations, infectious diseases will constitute a significant challenge for the public health and animal health communities in the twenty-first century. The African continent suffers from one of the highest burdens of infectious diseases of humans and animals in the world but has the least capacity for their detection, identification and monitoring. Lessons learnt from recent zoonotic epidemics in Africa and elsewhere clearly indicate the need for coordinated research, interdisciplinary centres, response systems and infrastructures, integrated surveillance systems and workforce development strategies. More and stronger partnerships across national and international sectors (human health, animal health, environment) and disciplines (natural and social sciences) involving public, academic and private organisations and institutions will be required to meet the present and future challenges of infectious diseases. In order to strengthen the efficiency of early warning systems, monitoring trends and disease prediction and timely outbreak interventions for the benefit of the national and international community, it is essential that each nation improves its own capacity in disease recognition and laboratory competence. The SACIDS, a One Health African initiative linking southern African academic and research institutions in smart partnership with centres of science excellence in industrialised countries as well as international research centres, strives to strengthen Africa's capacity to detect, identify and monitor infectious diseases of humans and animals, to better manage health and socio-economic risks posed by them, and to improve research capacity in investigation the biologic, socio-economic, ecologic and anthropogenic factors responsible for emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases."

Diagnostic techniques have been modified progressively over 30 years of surveillance of TB in wildlife, from initial characterisation of gross TB lesions in a variety of wildlife, through development of sensitive culture techniques to identify viable mycobacteria, to molecular identification of individual M. bovis strains. Of key importance in disease surveillance has been the elucidation of the roles that different wildlife species play in the transmission of infection, specifically defining brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) as true maintenance hosts compared to those that are predominantly spillover hosts, but which may serve as useful sentinel species to indicate TB persistence. Epidemiological modelling has played a major role in TB surveillance, initially providing the theoretical support for large-scale possum population control and setting targets at which control effort should be deployed to ensure disease eradication. As TB prevalence in livestock and wildlife declined throughout the 2000s, more varied field tools were developed to gather surveillance data from the diminishing possum populations, and to provide information on changing TB prevalence. Accordingly, ever more precise (but disparate) surveillance information began to be integrated into multi-faceted decision-assist models to support TB management decisions, particularly to provide informed parameters at which control effort could be halted, culminating in the Proof of Freedom modelling framework that now allows an area to be declared TB-free within chosen confidence limits. As New Zealand moves from large-scale TB control to regional eradication of disease in the coming years, further integrative models will need to be developed to support management decisions, based on combined field data of possum and TB prevalence, sentinel information, risk assessment in relation to financial benefits, and changing political and environmental needs."

Mortality in R. equi-infected HIV patients was lower in the HAART era (8%) than in pre-HAART era (56%) (P < 0.0001), suggesting that HAART improves prognosis in these patients.

In the last several years, forecast models have predicted that current summer temperatures are sufficient to facilitate extrinsic incubation of Dirofilaria in many areas of Europe. The global warming projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that warm summers suitable for Dirofilaria transmission in Europe will be the rule in the future decades, and if the actual trend of temperature increase continues, filarial infection should spread into previously infection-free areas. Dirofilaria repens is currently the filarial species that is most commonly reported as spreading from southern to northern areas.

The principal agent of canine dirofilariosis in the Americas is Dirofilaria immitis, which may also occasionally infest humans, resulting in pulmonary nodules that may be confounded with malignant lung tumours. Because human cases of dirofilariosis by D. immitis are relatively frequent in the Americas and rare in Europe and other eastern countries, where Dirofilaria repens is the main causative agent, the existence of a more virulent strain of D. immitis in the Americas has been speculated. Recently, a case of human ocular infestation by Dirofilaria sp. was diagnosed in Para State, northern Brazil, where canine heartworm dirofilariosis is endemic. The nematode was shown to be morphologically and phylogenetically related to D. immitis but it was genetically distinct from reference sequences, including those of D. immitis infesting dogs in the same geographical area. This finding raised questions regarding the aetiology of human dirofilariosis in the Americas, since information on the genetic makeup of filarioids infesting dogs and humans is meagre. Further studies would be needed to better characterize filarioids infesting dogs, wild animals, and humans in the Americas and to assess the existence of a more virulent D. immitis strain in this continent. Finally, the competence of different culicid species/strains from Europe and the Americas as vectors of Dirofilaria species should be investigated. Such studies would help us to understand possible variations in transmission patterns and even to predict possible scenarios that may emerge in the future, with the introduction of non-endemic Dirofilaria species/strains in free areas through importation of infested animals, vectors, or both."

Ecological immunology and disease ecology are two relatively young disciplines that apply ecological approaches and principles to traditionally non-ecological fields. In both cases, an ecological perspective has allowed new insights to emerge by focusing attention on variation over space and time, and by emphasizing the role of the environment in shaping individual responses and the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. Here we review the growing conceptual interface between these two rapidly evolving fields. 2. Areas of synergy between ecological immunology and disease ecology aim to translate variation in within-host processes (e.g. immunity) into between-host dynamics (e.g. parasite transmission). Emerging areas of synergy include potential immune mechanisms that underlie host heterogeneity in disease susceptibility, teasing apart the effects of environmental factors such as seasonality and climate on host susceptibility and pathogen dynamics, and predicting the outcome of co-infection by functionally distinct groups of parasites that elicit different immune responses. 3. In some cases, practical limitations have constrained the merging of ideas in ecological immunology and disease ecology. We discuss several logistical challenges, including dissecting the relative roles of host exposure and susceptibility, establishing links between measures of immunity and pathogen resistance in wild populations, and incorporating relevant immune variation into prevailing disease ecology modeling frameworks. 4. Future work at the interface of these two fields should advance understanding of life-history theory, host-pathogen dynamics, and physiological ecology, and will also contribute to targeted approaches for wildlife health and zoonotic disease prevention."

This is creating an explosion of related knowledge. Despite this, the dynamics of both wildlife and diseases and the changes in livestock and wildlife management make it increasingly difficult to overview the current situation of wildlife diseases in Europe. This paper aims to discuss the available management possibilities and to highlight current research priorities. One area that causes severe concern to authorities is diseases largely under control in domestic populations but still existing as a reservoir in wildlife. Multihost situations are also of concern for wildlife management and conservation, as diseases can affect the productivity and density of wildlife populations with an economic or recreational value. Concern about emerging diseases is rising in recent years, and these may well occur at the fertile livestock-wildlife interface. Wildlife-related zoonoses are a diverse and complex issue that requires a close collaboration between wildlife ecologists, veterinarians and public health professionals. A few risk factors can be identified in most of the relevant wildlife diseases. Among them are (1) the introduction of diseases through movements or translocations of wild or domestic animals, (2) the consequences of wildlife overabundance, (3) the risks of open air livestock breeding, (4) vector expansion and (5) the expansion or introduction of hosts. Wildlife disease control requires the integration of veterinary, ecology and wildlife management expertise. In addition to surveillance, attempts to control wildlife diseases or to avoid disease transmission between wildlife and livestock have been based on setting up barriers, culling, hygienic measures, habitat management, vector control, treatments and vaccination. Surveillance and descriptive studies are still valuable in regions, species or diseases that have received less attention or are (at least apparently) emerging. Nonetheless, limiting the research effort to the mere reporting of wildlife disease outbreaks is of limited value if management recommendations are not given at the same time. Thus, more experimental approaches are needed to produce substantial knowledge that enables authorities to make targeted management recommendations. This requires policy makers to be more aware of the value of science and to provide extra-funding for the establishment of multidisciplinary scientific teams."

For either type of study, new DNA-based diagnostic tests, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), present challenges in detecting the DNA of pathogens, which exist in low copy number compared with DNA of the host. One example comes from studies of avian malaria: conflicting claims are made by different laboratories about the accuracy of tests using various sets of primers and reagents, especially in relation to blood smears and immunological methods. There is little standardization of protocol or performance among laboratories conducting tests, in contrast to studies of human malaria. This review compares the problems of detecting avian malaria with those of detecting human malaria, and shows definitively that the buffer used to store blood samples following collection is associated with the accuracy of the test. Lower accuracy is associated with use of a lysis buffer, which apparently degrades the DNA in the blood sample and contributes to inhibition of PCR reactions. DNA extraction and purification techniques, and optimization of the PCR reaction, do not appear to be alternative explanations for the effect of storage buffer. Nevertheless, the purest DNA in standard concentrations for PCR is required so that different primers, DNA polymerases, and diagnostic tests can be objectively compared."

In the past century plant EIDs mostly resulted from the introduction of alien pathogens to new geographic areas as a consequence of international trade (i). However, other factors also played an important role, as for instance climate change (ii), which acts as a strong evolutionary force potentially enhancing the fitness or driving the expansion of the distribution range of pathogens, and/or weakening host plants i.e. predisposing them to infection. Global trade made geographically isolated pathogens spread beyond their natural range and hybridize with related species. Hybridization (iii) between previously isolated fungal pathogens has driven the emergence of new organisms with different and/or wider host range than the parental species. In some cases EIDs were caused by a hypervirulent strain of a known pathogen or by a completely new species, whose origin is still unclear (iv), which might be due to the development of novel traits or the acquisition of virulence from other species through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The sudden appearance of unforeseen diseases may be driven by cryptic disease agents, i.e. microorganisms indistinguishable from known species except for unapparent traits involved in pathogenesis, by pathogens with an extended latency period, or by endophytes capable of turning into pathogens after environment changes (v). New associations between introduced insect vectors and native tree pathogens (vi), or vice versa, may result into more efficient transmission and extended host- or geographic range of pathogens. The global use of intensively managed forest plantations (vii) of non-native trees or of a small number of clones of the same species over huge areas has increased the attacks by pathogens, which were accidentally introduced and/or adapted to new hosts. While the idea of totally preventing new EIDs appears unrealistic, it may be possible to reduce their occurrence, and the related damages and costs, by managing the drivers of disease emergence.

The scientific and medical community depends on timely publication of epidemiological information on emerging diseases during outbreaks to appropriately target public health responses. In this review, we considered the academic response to four MERS CoV outbreaks that occurred in Al-Hasa in 2013, Jeddah in 2014 and Riyadh in 2014 and 2015. We analysed 68 relevant epidemiology articles. For articles for which submission dates were available, six articles were submitted during the course of an outbreak. One article was published within a month of the Al-Hasa outbreak, and one each was accepted during the Jeddah and Riyadh outbreaks. MERS-CoV epidemiology articles were cited more frequently than articles on other subjects in the same journal issues. Thus, most epidemiology articles on MERS-CoV were published with no preferential advantage over other articles.

Recent evidence showed that alteration in the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) plays a key role in A beta-induced neurotoxicity. However, the activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs has distinct consequences for plasticity, gene regulation, neuronal death, and A beta production. This review focuses on the dysregulation of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs induced by A beta. On one hand, A beta downregulates the synaptic NMDAR response by promoting NMDAR endocytosis, leading to either neurotoxicity or neuroprotection. On the other hand, A beta enhances the activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs by decreasing neuronal glutamate uptake and inducing glutamate spillover, subsequently causing neurotoxicity. In addition, selective enhancement of synaptic activity by low doses of NMDA, or reduction of extrasynaptic activity by memantine, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist, halts A beta-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, future neuroprotective drugs for AD should aim at both the enhancement of synaptic activity and the disruption of extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent death signaling."

Immunity to TB depends critically on the generation of effective CD4(+) T-cell responses. Sterile immunity has not been achieved through vaccination, although early T-cell responses are effective in controlling steady-state infection in the lungs. Although such early T-cell responses are clearly protective, the initiation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) T-cell response occurs much later than is the case following other aerogenic infections. This fact suggests that there is a critical period, before the activation of the T-cell response, in which Mtb is able to establish infection. An understanding of the factors that regulate early T-cell activation should, therefore, lead to better control of the disease. This review discusses recent work that has investigated the early development of T-cell immunity following Mtb infection in the mouse."

The disease has led to major population declines in chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and gorillas Gorilla gorilla, and infected great apes play an important role as sources of human EVD outbreaks. The threat posed by EVD raises the question whether vaccination of wild apes is an effective strategy to reduce the occurrence and impact of this disease. We review the current knowledge about EVD in great apes and document the link between outbreaks in apes and in humans, mainly via bushmeat consumption. We discuss the need for control strategies, such as vaccination, and describe aspects of primate behaviour, virus biology, vaccine composition, and vaccination principles that need to be considered when making management decisions about great ape vaccination. Finally, we identify gaps in the understanding of Ebola ecology and highlight surveillance and research that can aid the survival of great apes and reduce human exposure to Ebola virus. The severe impact of EVD indicates the need for efficient monitoring and, ultimately, control of Ebola. However, the unknown reservoir and unpredictable emergence of Ebola, the elusive nature of great apes, and the lack of licensed and suitable vaccines represent major hurdles for such control. Public education about zoonotic diseases and monitoring of great ape health are both important strategies. Experts should also discuss the feasibility of developing safe vaccines that can be delivered efficiently to large populations of elusive wild apes in their natural remote habitats. This review provides a platform for further interdisciplinary discussions, so that management plans can be discussed and adjusted according to possible - future changes in the development, availability and cost of vaccines, the status of EVD, knowledge about Ebola ecology, and opinion on wildlife vaccination."

One possible way to treat patients, when no other treatment is yet developed, is passive immunization performed by transfusing blood, plasma or plasma immunoglobulin fractions obtained from convalescent donors who have recovered from the disease and have developed protective antibodies. The most recent on-going epidemic is caused by the Ebola virus, a filovirus responsible for Ebola virus disease, a severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever. Recently, the use of convalescent blood products was proposed by the WHO as one early option for treating patients with Ebola virus disease. This publication provides an overview of the various convalescent blood products and technological options that could theoretically be considered when there is a need to rely on this therapeutic approach. In countries without access to advanced blood-processing technologies, the choice may initially be restricted to convalescent whole blood or plasma. In technologically advanced countries, additional options for convalescent blood products are available, including virally inactivated plasma and fractionated immunoglobulins.

The disciplinary nature of most research activity has made it difficult to improve our understanding of interactions and feedback loops within the relevant systems.

Disease emergence and spread is strongly influenced by host density and contact structures, pathogen characteristics and pathogen population and molecular evolutionary dynamics in different host species, and host response to infection. All these mechanisms are strongly influenced by eco-social processes, such as globalization and urbanization, which lead to changes in global ecosystem dynamics, including patterns of mobility, human population density and contact structures, and food production and consumption. An improved understanding of epidemiological and eco-social processes, including their interdependence, will be essential to be able to manage diseases in these circumstances. The interfaces between wild animals, domestic animals and humans need to be examined to identify the main risk pathways and put in place appropriate mitigation.

Activities range from those focusing purely on capacity, projects focusing on research and projects covering both. Achievements to date include, for example, research contributing to the field of infectious diseases in relation to social ecological factors and associated urbanisation and agricultural intensification. Challenges remain at the project design and implementation level, in the available capacity and coordination to develop Ecohealth research teams in the countries, gauging teams' assimilation of Ecohealth's underlying tenets and their translation into sustainable disease prevention and control, as well as in the ability to scale up Ecohealth projects.

These three conditions-human monocytic (or monocytotropic) ehrlichiosis (HME), Ehrlichia ewingii ehrlichiosis, and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI)-undoubtedly existed in the United States prior to this time. However, the near-simultaneous recognition of these diseases is remarkable and suggests the involvement of a unifying process that thrust multiple pathogens into the sphere of human recognition. Previous works by other investigators have emphasized the pivotal role of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the emergence of Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Because whitetails serve as a keystone host for all stages of lone star ticks, and an important reservoir host for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. ewingii, and Borrelia lonestari, the near-exponential growth of white-tailed deer populations that occurred in the eastern United States during the twentieth century is likely to have dramatically affected the frequency and distribution of A. americanum-associated zoonoses. This chapter describes the natural histories of the pathogens definitively or putatively associated with HME, E. ewingii ehrlichiosis, and STARI; the role of white-tailed deer as hosts to lone star ticks and the agents of these diseases; and the cascade of ecologic disturbances to the landscape of the United States that have occurred during the last 200 years that provided critical leverage in the proliferation of white-tailed deer, and ultimately resulted in the emergence of these diseases in human populations."

The pathogen infects multiple amphibian hosts, larval and adult cohorts, and may persist in herpetofaunal and osteichthyan reservoirs. Environmental persistence of ranavirus virions outside a host may be several weeks or longer in aquatic systems. Transmission Occurs by indirect and direct routes, and includes exposure to contaminated water or soil, casual or direct contact with infected individuals, and ingestion of infected tissue during predation, cannibalism, or necrophagy. Some gross lesions include swelling of the limbs or body, erythema, swollen friable livers, and hemorrhage, Susceptible amphibians usually die from chronic cell death in multiple organs, which can occur within a few days following infection or may take several weeks. Amphibian species differ in their susceptibility to ranaviruses, which may be related to their co-evolutionary history with the pathogen. The occurrence of recent widespread amphibian population die-offs from ranaviruses may be an interaction of suppressed and naive host immunity, anthropogenic stressors, and novel strain introduction. This review summarizes the ecological research on amphibian ranaviruses, discusses possible drivers of emergence and conservation strategies, and presents ideas for future research directions. We also discuss common pathological signs of ranaviral disease, methods for diagnostic evaluation, and ranavirus Surveillance methods. Inasmuch as ranaviral disease is listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health and is a threat to amphibian survival, we recommend that biosecurity precautions are implemented by nations to reduce the likelihood of transporting ranavirus virions among populations. Biosecurity precautions include disinfecting footwear and equipment that comes in contact with surface water inhabited by amphibians and testing commercially shipped amphibians for the pathogen. We also encourage natural resource organizations to establish routine surveillance programs for ranaviruses in wild amphibian populations."

Assessment of several important cases reveals that pathogens responsible for infectious diseases in wild species can be readily transmitted between hosts, leading to short-term epizootic infections that can threaten vulnerable declining populations. Habitat destruction and the introduction of alien species were identified as significant environmental variables that affect the ecology of emerging infectious diseases, while pollution and weather change were found to favor transmission and the creation of new hosts.

However, the role that infectious disease plays within ecological communities is complex. The complex effects of infectious disease at the scale of communities and ecosystems are driven by the interaction between host and pathogen. Whether or not a given host-pathogen interaction results in progression from infection to disease is largely dependent on the physiological characteristics of the host within the context of the external environment. Here, we highlight the importance of understanding the outcome of infection and disease in the context of host ecophysiology using amphibians as a model system. Amphibians are ideal for such a discussion because many of their populations are experiencing declines and extinctions, with disease as an important factor implicated in many declines and extinctions. Exposure to pathogens and the host's responses to infection can be influenced by many factors related to physiology such as host life history, immunology, endocrinology, resource acquisition, behaviour and changing climates. In our review, we discuss the relationship between disease and biodiversity. We highlight the dynamics of three amphibian host-pathogen systems that induce different effects on hosts and life stages and illustrate the complexity of amphibian-host-parasite systems.

In addition, their movements must be carefully timed to ensure that they obtain resources of sufficient quantity and quality to satisfy their high-energy needs. Migratory birds may therefore be particularly vulnerable to global change processes that are projected to alter the quality and quantity of resource availability. Because long-distance flight requires high and sustained aerobic capacity, even minor decreases in vitality can have large negative consequences for migrants. In the light of this, we assess how current global change processes may affect the ability of birds to meet the physiological demands of migration, and suggest areas where avian physiologists may help to identify potential hazards. Predicting the consequences of global change scenarios on migrant species requires (i) reconciliation of empirical and theoretical studies of avian flight physiology; (ii) an understanding of the effects of food quality, toxicants and disease on migrant performance; and (iii) mechanistic models that integrate abiotic and biotic factors to predict migratory behaviour.

However, evidence has been largely circumstantial, and much uncertainty remains. Here, I review the latest information on both the predicted effects of climate change in coastal marine ecosystems and current research on coral-pathogen dynamics in relation to climate variables. The published evidence supports the hypothesis that coral infectious diseases are emerging and demonstrates that coral disease research has been exponentially expanding over the last few decades. Current research suggests that environmental factors, such as ocean warming, altered rainfall, increased storm frequency, sea level rise, altered circulation, and ocean acidification may play a role in coral disease. These climate variables likely alter coral epidemiology through effects on pathogen growth rates, transmission, virulence, and susceptibility. Despite recent advances, discovering the causes of coral disease emergence at large spatial and temporal scales has been hindered by several factors including (1) the inability to rely on Koch's postulates for diseases with multifactorial etiologies, (2) the paucity of long-term, coordinated, coral disease data, and (3) the difficulty in detecting correlations in inherently non-linear, dynamic disease systems. In a rapidly changing global environment, the consequences of increasing coral disease may be severe, leading to elevated extinction risk and loss of critical reef habitat. Current evidence is still preliminary but is increasingly suggestive that mitigating the effects of climate change may help reduce the emergence of disease and improve the health of coral reef ecosystems:"

The majority of the reported waterborne outbreaks are related to microbial agents (parasites, bacteria and viruses). Rural areas are characterized by high livestock density and lack of advanced treatment systems for animal and human waste, and wastewater. Animal waste from livestock production facilities is often applied to land without prior treatment. Biosolids (treated municipal wastewater sludge) from large wastewater facilities in urban areas are often transported and applied to land in rural areas. This situation introduces a potential for risk of human exposure to waterborne contaminants such as human and zoonotic pathogens originating from manure, biosolids, and leaking septic systems. This paper focuses on waterborne outbreaks and sources of microbial pollution in rural areas in the US, characterization of the microbial load of biosolids and manure, association of biosolid and manure application with microbial contamination of surface and groundwater, risk assessment and best management practice for biosolids and manure application to protect water quality. Gaps in knowledge are identified, and recommendations to improve the water quality in the rural areas are discussed."

Therefore, it is imperative to understand how diseases impact wildlife populations so that effective management strategies can be planned. Many studies have focused on understanding the ecology of host/pathogen interactions, but it is equally important to understand the effects on host population genetic structure. In this review, we examined the literature on how infectious diseases influence host population genetic makeup, with a particular focus on whether or not they alter gene flow patterns, reduce genetic variability, and drive selection. Although the results were mixed, there was evidence for all of these outcomes. Diseases often fragmented populations into small, genetically distinct units with limited gene flow among them. In some cases, these isolated populations showed the genetic hallmarks of bottlenecks and inbreeding, but in other populations, there was sufficient gene flow or enough survivors to prevent genetic drift and inbreeding. Direct evidence of diseases acting as selective pressures in wild populations is somewhat limited, but there are several clear examples of it occurring. Also, several studies found that gene flow can impact the evolution of small populations either beneficially, by providing them with variation, or detrimentally, by swamping them with alleles that are not locally adaptive. Thus, differences in gene flow levels may explain why some species adapt while others do not. There are also intermediate cases, whereby some species may adapt to disease, but not at a rate that is meaningful for conservation purposes."

At an organism level, effects encompass not only endocrine disruptions, sex-ratio changes and decreased reproductive parameters, but also include teratogenic and genotoxic effects, immunosuppression and other immune-system impairments that can lead directly to disease or increase the risk of acquiring disease. Living organisms will strive to maintain health by recognizing and resolving abnormal situations, such as the presence of invading microorganisms or harmful peptides, abnormal cell replication and deleterious mutations. However, fast-paced environmental changes may pose additional pressure on immunocompetence and health maintenance, which may seriously impact population viability and persistence. Here, we outline the importance of a functional immune system for survival and examine the effects that exposure to a rapidly changing environment might exert on immunocompetence. We then address the various levels at which anthropogenic environmental change might affect wildlife health and identify potential deficits in reproductive parameters that might arise owing to new immune challenges in the context of a rapidly changing environment. Throughout the paper, a series of examples and case studies are used to illustrate the impact of environmental change on wildlife health."

The review is focused on environmental factors that directly depend on, or that are known to interact with forest management, such as tree (and forest) age and size, tree species composition, large scale factors (e.g. climate and air pollution), landscape context, and past forest history. The literature demonstrates the sensitiveness of epiphytic lichens to forestry: forest management, and especially the shelterwood system, is a source of threat for many forest-dwelling lichens. Several studies include explicit recommendations for mitigating the effect of forestry. The main ones are: (a) selective cutting should be preferred to the shelterwood system; (b) the negative effect of the shelterwood system could be mitigated by the extension of the rotation period and by the retention of groups of mature trees at the final harvest; (c) the creation of stands with intermediate canopy openness should be promoted; (d) logs and snags should be retained in production forests; (e) large old trees should be maintained in production forests and some of them left until dead and decomposed (""eternity trees""); (f) tree species diversity should be maintained in mixed stands; (g) forest fragments around existing species-rich oldgrowth remnants should be maintained, to create a network of set-aside areas; (h) indicator species could be used for a rapid assessment of forest sites worthy of conservation. However, some topics are still scarcely explored, such as the case of (a) coppice forests, (b) the evaluation of the landscape context and forest history, (c) dead wood-dwelling communities and the role of different types of dead wood for lichen conservation, (d) the effects of emerging infectious diseases, and (e) the use of indicator species to assess the conservation importance of forests.

We reviewed only three mosquito-borne diseases: malaria, dengue fever, and the Japanese encephalitis. Billions of people get infected with those diseases and millions of people die every year. Although we struggle to find the most effective way to control mosquitoes using various methods (including pesticides), mosquito-borne diseases are still among the most serious problems being faced. This paper, therefore, reviews the strategies for controlling mosquitoes. The use of pesticides to control mosquitoes might have more negative effects on humans and environments than benefits. Although the development of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes raises new hopes for effective mosquito control, it will take longer to assess the risks to humans and environments. Furthermore, there has been concern about the possible adverse effects from the release of GM mosquitoes into the environment. The various mosquito traps may not be as effective at controlling only female mosquito populations. Therefore, new strategies for the control of mosquitoes are vital. The smart mosquito counter device was developed by Korean Centre for Disease Control (KCDC) in 2013. The mosquito pest control office is able to set up the appropriate mosquito control strategies by using quantitative mosquito information. The smart device will bring mosquito control in line with modern smart generation technology and the device will also soon be able to identify different mosquito species. This new strategy will change the methods of mosquito control and will provide beneficial effects toward sustainable nature and human health."

Numerous mechanisms could be behind this decline, and the spread of parasites from commercial colonies into wild populations has been implicated recently in North America. Commercial breeding may lead to declines because commercial colonies may have high parasite loads, which can lead to colonization of native bumble bee populations; commercial rearing may allow higher parasite virulence to evolve; and global movement of commercial colonies may disrupt spatial patterns in local adaptation between hosts and parasites. We assessed parasite virulence, transmission mode, and infectivity. Microparasites and so-called honey bee viruses may pose the greatest threat to native bumble bee populations because certain risk factors are present; for example, the probability of horizontal transmission of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi is high. The microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi may play a role in declines of bumble bees in the United States. Preliminary indications that C. bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi may not be native in parts of South America. We suggest that the development of molecular screening protocols, thorough sanitation efforts, and cooperation among nongovernmental organizations, governments, and commercial breeders might immediately mitigate these threats."

It is characterized by the loss of a specific cell type and low anatomic complexity of the function in need of restoration. Although embryonic stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into any cell type, inefficient differentiation into beta cells has been common. Recent findings An essential challenge is to devise routine methods for generating enriched populations of defined pancreatic precursor or beta cells. Enriched populations of human embryonic stem cell-derived insulin-expressing cells have yet to demonstrate physiologically relevant function. Advances in our understanding of developmental mechanisms are fueling progress towards developing protocols for differentiation of embryonic stem cells into desired lineages for transplantation. Other challenges being intensively studied are the prevention of possible transmission of zoonotic infections and the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to derive human embryonic stem cells which may be useful for therapeutic applications. Summary Many challenges remain in embryonic stem cell research. Initial preclinical and phase I trials should focus on safety with respect to both teratoma formation and genetic stability of cells after transplantation. With in-depth knowledge of the signals and genes involved in endoderm and islet development, it should be possible to recapitulate the process for the production of a virtually unlimited source of transplantable insulin-producing cells."

A wide variety of emerging and re-emerging viruses contribute to this disease burden. New emerging infections are commonly due to RNA viruses that have expanded their geographic range, spread from animal reservoirs or acquired new neurovirulence properties. Mosquito-borne viruses with expanding ranges include West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Chikungunya virus. Zoonotic viruses that have recently crossed into humans to cause neurologic disease include the bat henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, as well as the primate-derived human immunodeficiency virus. Viruses adapt to new hosts, or to cause more severe disease, by changing their genomes through reassortment (e.g. influenza virus), mutation (essentially all RNA viruses) and recombination (e.g. vaccine strains of poliovirus). Viruses that appear to have recently become more neurovirulent include West Nile virus, enterovirus 71 and possibly Chikungunya virus. In addition to these newer challenges, rabies, polio and measles all remain important causes of neurologic disease despite good vaccines and global efforts toward control. Control of human rabies depends on elimination of rabies in domestic dogs through regular vaccination. Poliovirus eradication is challenged by the ability of the live attenuated vaccine strains to revert to virulence during the prolonged period of gastrointestinal replication. Measles elimination depends on delivery of two doses of live virus vaccine to a high enough proportion of the population to maintain herd immunity for this highly infectious virus.

Worldwide efforts to combat the disease by oral vaccination of reservoirs have managed to eradicate wildlife rabies in large areas of central Europe and North-America. Thus, repeated vaccination has been discontinued recently on a geographical scale. However, as rabies has not yet been eradicated globally, a serious risk of re-introduction remains. What is the best spatial design for an emergency vaccination program - particularly if resources are limited? Either, we treat a circular area around the detected case and run the risk of infected hosts leaving the limited control area, because a sufficient immunisation level has not yet been built up. Or, initially concentrate the SAME resources in order to establish a protective ring which is more distant from the infected local area, and which then holds out against the challenge of the approaching epidemic. Methods: We developed a simulation model to contrast the two strategies for emergency vaccination. The spatial-explicit model is based on fox group home-ranges, which facilitates the simulation of rabies spread to larger areas relevant to management. We used individual-based fox groups to follow up the effects of vaccination in a detailed manner. Thus, regionally-bait distribution orientates itself to standard schemes of oral immunisation programs and locally - baits are assigned to individual foxes. Results: Surprisingly, putting the controlled area ring-like around the outbreak does not outperform the circular area of the same size centred on the outbreak. Only during the very first baitings, does the ring area result in fewer breakouts. But then as rabies is eliminated within the circle area, the respective ring area fails, due to the non-controlled inner part. We attempt to take advantage of the initially fewer breakouts beyond the ring when applying a mixed strategy. Therefore, after a certain number of baitings, the area under control was increased for both strategies towards the same larger circular area. The circle-circle strategy still outperforms the ring-circle strategy and analysis of the spatial-temporal disease spread reveals why: improving control efficacy by means of a mixed strategy is impossible in the field, due to the build-up time of population immunity. Conclusion: For practical emergency management of a new outbreak of rabies, the ring-like application of oral vaccination is not a favourable strategy at all. Even if initial resources are substantially low and there is a serious risk of rabies cases outside the limited control area, our results suggest circular application instead of ring vaccination."

With the occurrence of AIDS and the discovery of new pathogens the come-back of infectious diseases was noted, 15 to 20 years later, and the concept of emerging infections was defined. An emerging infection is the appearance of a new infection or the increase of its incidence if not new. It also includes infections for which the incidence could increase because of favorable conditions. Several scenarios can be proposed: 1) the appearance of a new infection (AIDS or SARS); 2) the appearance of a known infection where it did not exist previously (West Nile virus infection in the USA); 3) an infection that existed but that was not diagnosed or could not be linked precisely to a particular infectious agent (hepatitis C before the discovery of the hepatitis C virus; 4) a known infection that increases its usual incidence (outbreaks...); 5) infectious diseases for which current conditions may facilitate transmission (decrease of immunization coverage...). The deliberate release of a biological agent is one of the possible scenarios of emergence. Qualitative changes of infectious agents such as the resistance to anti-infectious agents may also contribute, through a selection mechanism, to the emergence of new infectious threat. Emerging infections result from the interaction between the agent, the host, and environment evolving according to human activity. Surveillance, research, laboratory capacity, and an effective public health system are key factors for their control. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves."

A majority of domestic cats may harbor the intra-erythrocytic agent for extended periods without apparent disease. In humans, B. henselae most commonly results in a subacute, bacterial infection that presents with one or more reddish papules which may progress to pustules and regional lymph node enlargement. Usual features include fever, malaise, and a granulomatous lymphadenitis on biopsy. However, atypical clinical presentations occur, albeit with infrequence, and may result in a difficult and protracted diagnostic process. The infection in susceptible hosts such as immunocompromised or elderly patients may result in endocarditis, encephalitis, fever of unknown origin, and general malaise. It is not transmitted from person to person and quarantine is not necessary. The arthropod vector, Ctenocephalides felis, or the cat flea, plays a major role in transmission among cats and to humans. The transmission risk to humans can be substantially reduced through elimination of flea infestations in companion animals. There are numerous recent reviews and case reports in the veterinary and medical literature reflecting increased recognition of this zoonotic agent. All this notwithstanding, many physicians and other providers may not be familiar with this agent and the potential spectrum of human disease; this may lead to delays in diagnosis and unnecessary diagnostic procedures.

Currently culture and other conventional diagnostic methods are the cornerstone of diagnosis. Molecular methods to directly detect and identify mould pathogens in tissue and body fluids are increasingly used. A.P.

The pathogens responsible for such mycoses are now quite well characterized, such as Aspergillus spp. - the most commonly isolated mold -, Mucorales, Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. or melanized fungi. An increase in the incidence of this category of 'emerging' fungi has been recently highlighted, evoking a shift in fungal ecology. Starting from these medical findings, taking a step back and adopt a wider perspective offers possible explanations of this phenomenon on an even larger scale than previously reported. In this review, we illustrate the link between emerging fungi in medicine and changes in ecology or human behaviours, and we encourage integrative approaches to apprehend the adverse effects of progress and develop preventive measures in vast domains, such as agriculture or medicine."

Despite this achievement, TTIDs remain a public health concern, and attention is refocusing on new and emerging pathogens, such as West Nile virus, infectious proteins (the presumed cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), and other transmissible organisms such as bacteria and parasites. In this article the authors concentrate on this heterogeneous group of infectious agents, describe individual pathogens and the risks they pose to transfusion recipients, and comment on existing and evolving procedures that are designed to protect the blood supply from this threat."

HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1 avian influenza, and many other emerging diseases have either proved fatal or caused international alarm. Common and interactive co-determinants of disease emergence, including population growth, travel, and environmental disruption, have been increasingly documented and studied. Are emerging infections a new phenomenon related to modern life, or do more basic determinants, transcending time, place, and human progress, govern disease generation? By examining a number of historically notable epidemics, we suggest that emerging diseases, similar in their novelty, impact, and elicitation of control responses, have occurred throughout recorded history. Fundamental determinants, typically acting in concert, seem to underlie their emergence, and infections such as these are likely to continue to remain challenges to human survival."
3793,Joy,YES,NO,"Kahn, RE; Clouser, DF; Richt, JA",emerging infections: a tribute to the one medicine one health concept,2009,ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Web of Science,"P>Events in the last decade have taught us that we are now, more than ever, vulnerable to fatal zoonotic diseases such as those caused by haemorrhagic fever viruses, influenza, rabies and BSE/vCJD. Future research activities should focus on solutions to these problems arising at the interface between animals and humans. A 4-fold classification of emerging zoonoses was proposed: Type 1: from wild animals to humans (Hanta); Type 1 plus: from wild animals to humans with further human-to-human transmission (AIDS); Type 2: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans (Avian flu) and Type 2 plus: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans, with further human-to-human transmission (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The resulting holistic approach to emerging infections links microbiology, veterinary medicine, human medicine, ecology, public health and epidemiology. As emerging 'new' respiratory viruses are identified in many wild and domestic animals, issues of interspecies transmission have become of increasing concern. The development of safe and effective human and veterinary vaccines is a priority. For example, the spread of different influenza viruses has stimulated influenza vaccine development, just as the spread of Ebola and Marburg viruses has led to new approaches to filovirus vaccines. Interdisciplinary collaboration has become essential because of the convergence of human disease, animal disease and a common approach to biosecurity. High containment pathogens pose a significant threat to public health systems, as well as a major research challenge, because of limited experience in case management, lack of appropriate resources in affected areas and a limited number of animal research facilities in developed countries. Animal models that mimic certain diseases are key elements for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, as well as for the development and efficacy testing of therapeutics and vaccines. An updated veterinary curriculum is essential to empower future graduates to work in an international environment, applying international standards for disease surveillance, veterinary public health, food safety and animal welfare."

These pathogens evolve to exploit novel opportunities for spread and transmission, such as fresh produce within the food chain, and generate new public health challenges. Organic sprouts were recently considered as the source responsible for a large German disease outbreak comprising 3842 patients. The outbreak strain was identified as an enteroaggregative STEC O104:H4 (EAggC), a rare hybrid pathogen that harbours the phage encoded Shiga toxin gene and antibiotic resistance in an EAggEC background. Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 is emerging across Europe, causing severe disease outside healthcare facilities as well as disease in farm animals, indicating that the species border has been crossed. Although the global impact of cryptosporidiosis is less pronounced, these organisms have been responsible for large outbreaks of infectious diarrhoea, often not reported. Invasive listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness and was found recently in 28 US states affecting 147 patients, associated with eating contaminated cantaloupe. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by Listeria monocytogenes are most likely severely underestimated. Centralized surveillance of food-borne enteropathogens is essential for the early detection of disease outbreaks and for the organization of an immediate and appropriate response.SummaryAn improved understanding of the pathogenesis, pathology and epidemiology of emerging enteropathogens causing infectious colitis will provide new approaches for disease prevention and control."

We must look to the responses of recent outbreaks to help guide our strategies in current and future outbreaks or we risk repeating the same mistakes. The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic literature review of the methodology used by studies that examined EID communication during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic outbreak through different communication channels or by analyzing contents and strategies. Methods: This was a systematic review of the literature (n = 61) studying risk communication strategies of H1N1 influenza, published between 2009 and 2013, and retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts by use of specific search criteria. Searches were followed by review, categorization, and mixed qualitative and quantitative content analysis. Results: Of 41 articles that used quantitative methods, most used surveys (n = 35); some employed content analyses (n = 4) and controlled trials (n = 2). The 16 articles that employed qualitative methods relied on content analyses (n = 10), semi-structured interviews (n = 2) and focus groups (n = 4). Four more articles used mixed-methods or nonstandard methods. Seven different topic categories were found: risk perception and effects on behaviors, framing the risk in the media, public concerns, trust, optimistic bias, uncertainty, and evaluating risk communication. Conclusions: Up until 2013, studies tended to be descriptive and quantitative rather than discursive and qualitative and to focus on the role of the media as representing information and not as a medium for actual communication with the public. Several studies from 2012, and increasingly more in 2013, addressed issues of discourse and framing and the complexity of risk communication with the public. Formative evaluations that use recommendations from past research when designing communication campaigns from the first stages of crises are recommended. Research should employ diverse triangulation processes based on representatives from different stakeholders. Further studies should address the potential offered by social media to create dialogue with individuals and the public at large."

EID agents may represent a threat to blood safety if they infect humans, cause a clinically significant illness, include an asymptomatic blood phase in the course of infection, and are transmissible by transfusion. EID agents are typically not well characterised, but there is a consensus that we can expect ongoing outbreaks. Strategies to manage the risk to blood safety from EIDs include ongoing surveillance, regular risk assessments, modelling transfusion transmission risk, and deferral of donors with a recent travel history to outbreak areas. The 2015-16 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas is the largest reported ZIKV outbreak to date, and it highlights the unpredictable nature of EID outbreaks and how quickly they can become a major public health problem. This ZIKV outbreak has provided evidence of a causal link between the virus and microcephaly in newborns. In assessing the potential risk of ZIKV to blood safety in Australia, it should be noted that a relatively small number of imported ZIKV infections have been reported in Australia, there have been no reported cases of local ZIKV transmission, and the geographical distribution of the potential ZIKV mosquito vector in Australia (Aedes aegypti) is limited to northern Queensland. Moreover, reported transfusion-transmitted ZIKV cases worldwide are rare. At present, ZIKV represents a low risk to blood safety in Australia."

Many such infections are known to be transmissible by blood transfusion, while others have properties indicating this potential. There has been no comprehensive review of such infectious agents and their threat to transfusion recipient safety to date. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The members of AABB's Transfusion Transmitted Diseases Committee reviewed a large number of information sources in order to identify infectious agents with actual or potential risk of transfusion transmission now or in the future in the US or Canada; with few exceptions, these agents do not have available interventions to reduce the risk of such transmission. Using a group discussion and writing process, key characteristics of each agent were identified, researched, recorded and documented in standardized format. A group process was used to prioritize each agent on the basis of scientific/epidemiologic data and a subjective assessment of public perception and/or concern expressed by regulatory agencies. RESULTS: Sixty-eight infectious agents were identified and are described in detail in a single Supplement to TRANSFUSION. Key information will also be provided in web-based form and updated as necessary. The highest priorities were assigned to Babesia species, Dengue virus, and vCJD. CONCLUSION: The information is expected to support the needs of clinicians and transfusion medicine experts in the recognition and management of emerging infections among blood donors and blood recipients."

The increasing number of children adopted internationally (>20 000 in 2003, from the United States State Department) provides a unique situation for the spread of emerging infections through the combination of international travel by parents through areas where such infections may be contracted and the nature of the living conditions for many of the orphans being placed by this process. Recent findings The recent literature on three emerging infections - avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and measles - describes clinical aspects of the illnesses and their epidemiology. For avian influenza aspects of the agrarian economy in southeast Asia enabled the virus to reach the human population. The potential for further adaptation to people could set the stage for a new pandemic. SARS evolved in rural China and spread worldwide in one season with an approximate 10% mortality. Attention to public-health measures led to control of this new illness. Most recently, outbreaks of measles in Chinese orphanages have been documented. These findings demonstrate the potential of such infections to be transmitted during the process of international adoption, and in the case of measles the realization of this potential in recent reported cases from Chinese orphanages brought to the United States on commercial airlines. Summary Clinicians involved in international adoption and public-health officials assessing emerging infections need to work together in monitoring these issues."

Study design: A systematic review was conducted with the use of Medline searches, searches of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and review by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: The 3 emerging infectious diseases pose very different threats: Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a newly identified pathogen that caused an international pandemic; the West Nile virus investigation involved an old pathogen that was identified in a new location; and the anthrax attacks involved the intentional introduction of a pathogen. Conclusion: All 3 outbreaks highlight the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists keeping current with new information as it emerges. In this global environment, it is likely that novel disease threats will continue to emerge in the United States. (c) 2006 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved."

Two published models for estimating the transfusion-transmission risk from EID5, referred to as the Biggerstaff-Petersen model and the European Upfront Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT), respectively, have been applied to several EIDs in outbreak situations. We describe and compare the methodological principles of both models, highlighting their similarities and differences. We also discuss the appropriateness of comparing results from the two models. Quantitating the TT risk of EIDs can inform decisions about risk mitigation strategies and their cost-effectiveness. Finally, we present a qualitative risk assessment for Zika virus (ZIKV), an EID agent that has caused several outbreaks since 2007. In the latest and largest ever outbreak, several probable cases of transfusion-transmission ZIKV have been reported, indicating that it is transfusion-transmissible and therefore a risk to blood safety.

Devastating epidemics, having social implications by increasing the rate of urbanization, occurred in the past in Europe, and many other EIDs still occur with high frequency in developing countries. Although the ability to diagnose diseases and the technologies available for their control are far greater than in the past, EIDs are still able to cause tremendous crop losses, the economic and social impact of which, in developing countries, is often underestimated. In the present article, four of the most important EIDs in developing countries are considered from the standpoint of their origin, characteristics, symptoms, mode of spread, possible control strategies, economic impact and the socio-economic consequences of their dissemination. They are Cassava Mosaic Virus Disease, capable of reducing yields by 80-90% and causing the suspension of cassava cultivation in many areas of East Africa; Striga hermonthica, a parasitic weed affecting cereals in an area of at least 5 million hectares in Sub-Saharan Africa; Xanthomonas Wilt of Banana, a bacterial disease that caused around 50% yield losses at the beginning of 21st century in Uganda and is threatening the food security of about 70 million people owing to its impact on an important staple crop; and race Ug99 of the rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, which is having a tremendous impact on wheat in Uganda, and is also threatening most of the wheat-growing countries of the world."

However, newly recognized blood-borne infectious agents can be threats to blood safety. In order to evaluate the prevalence some of these agents in blood donors, a systematic review was conducted. Data were obtained from published papers related to HGV, Torque Teno virus (TTV), HTLV, West Nile virus (WNV) and SEN virus (SEN-V). Based on these studies, the prevalence of HGV varied from 1 to 8.6% for anti-E2 and from 0 to 4.8% for HGV RNA.

Two outbreaks; West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome, have recently provided important lessons on how transplant patients are affected, and how transplant programmes must adapt and evolve in the face of emerging infections. An update of emerging infections in transplant patients, using West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome as specific examples, is summarized here. Recent findings Exogenous immunosuppression, specific allograft factors, and extensive contact with the healthcare system all predispose transplant patients to emerging infections. Transplant patients may acquire West Nile virus through blood transfusion, donor transmission; or community exposure. Seroprevalence data in transplant populations suggest the risk of severe neurological disease is several fold higher in transplant recipients who acquire West Nile virus compared with immunocompetent individuals. Prevention strategies are critical in this population. These include nucleic acid testing of blood products and potentially also screening organ donors in a similar manner. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, transplant patients with severe and rapidly progressive disease were reported. Higher viral burdens appeared to be present in transplant patients and may have implications for the increased infectivity of these patients. Transplant programmes in severe acute respiratory syndrome areas were also adversely affected because of donor concerns, recipient issues and resource problems. Summary Transplant patients are uniquely predisposed to emerging infections. Lessons learned from West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome in transplantation should be applicable to future outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases."

The relevant literature on this infection is reviewed. Methods: Descriptive case report and a review of the literature (PubMed search). Results: A 39-year-old woman on maintenance therapy for systemic ANCA-associated vasculitis, diagnosed 10 months earlier and with persistent microscopic hematuria, developed recurrent pelvic pain. She had received several immunosuppressants (including cyclophosphamide and rituximab) since the onset of her vasculitis, as well as cycles of broad-spectrum antibiotics during the acute initial phase of her disease. Computerized tomography of the pelvis and cystoscopy showed several encrusted calcifications in the bladder mucosa, and, finally, urine culture (selective media) led to the diagnosis of C. urealyticum infection. Most of the bladder-encrusted stones were removed during cystoscopy and daily intramuscular teicoplanin injections were given for 14 days. Her symptoms disappeared rapidly and completely. On reviewing the literature, immunosuppression, previous broad-spectrum antibiotics, urogenital alkaline pH, and prolonged bladder catheterization are predisposing factors for this rare infection. C. urealyticum encrusting cystitis has been reported in patients with systemic diseases but not yet in ANCA-associated vasculitis. Outcome is almost always good under adequate antibiotic therapy, mainly glycopeptides.

Outbreaks have been recorded for decades in countries with enzootic circulation, and the recent implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with previously unknown VEE activity. Clinically, VEE is indistinguishable from dengue and other arboviral diseases and confirmatory diagnosis requires the use of specialized laboratory tests that are difficult to afford in resource-limited regions. Thus, the disease burden of endemic VEE in developing countries remains largely unknown, but recent surveillance suggests that it may represent up to 10% of the dengue burden in neotropical cities, or tens-of-thousands of cases per year throughout Latin America. The potential emergence of epizootic viruses from enzootic progenitors further highlights the need to strengthen surveillance activities, identify mosquito vectors and reservoirs and develop effective strategies to control the disease. In this article, we provide an overview of the current status of endemic VEE that results from spillover of the enzootic cycles, and we discuss public health measures for disease control as well as future avenues for VEE research."

In this report, the authors review the recent activities of AFHSC-GEIS partner laboratories in regards to enteric disease surveillance, prevention and response. Each partner identified recent accomplishments, including support for regional networks. AFHSC/GEIS partners also completed a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) survey as part of a landscape analysis of global enteric surveillance efforts. The current strengths of this network include excellent laboratory infrastructure, equipment and personnel that provide the opportunity for high-quality epidemiological studies and test platforms for point-of-care diagnostics. Weaknesses include inconsistent guidance and a splintered reporting system that hampers the comparison of data across regions or longitudinally. The newly chartered Enterics Surveillance Steering Committee (ESSC) is intended to provide clear mission guidance, a structured project review process, and central data management and analysis in support of rationally directed enteric disease surveillance efforts."

Using recently updated data sets from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, we evaluated the incidence of perceived threats to all known mammal, bird, and amphibian species in tropical forests. Vulnerable, endangered, and extinct species were collectively far more likely to be imperiled by combinations of threats than expected by chance. Among 45 possible pairwise combinations of 10 different threats, 69%, 93%, and 71% were significantly more frequent than expected for threatened mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, even with a stringent Bonferroni-corrected probability value (p = 0.003). Based on this analysis, we identified five key environmental synergisms in the tropics and speculate on the existence of others. The most important involve interactions between habitat loss or alteration (from agriculture, urban sprawl, infrastructure, or logging) and other anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting, fire, exotic-species invasions, or pollution. Climatic change and emerging pathogens also can interact with other threats. We assert that environmental synergisms are more likely the norm than the exception for threatened species and ecosystems, can vary markedly in nature among geographic regions and taxa, and may be exceedingly difficult to predict in terms of their ultimate impacts. The perils posed by environmental synergisms highlight the need for a precautionary approach to tropical biodiversity conservation."

This neurotropic nematode has a definitive rodent host and a molluscan intermediate host. The adult worms live in the pulmonary arteries of rats. Human is a non-permissive, accidental host. Transmission to humans is by eating of infected raw or undercooked snails, poorly cleaned contaminated vegetables or other infected paratenic hosts such as freshwater prawns, crabs, frogs or monitor lizards. Thousands of diagnosed cases of eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis have been reported worldwide. Angiostrongyliasis is of increasing public health importance as globalization contributes to the geographical spread and more international travelers encounter the disease. The parasite is on the move. It has spread from its traditional endemic areas of Asia and the Pacific Basin to the American continent including the USA, Brazil and Caribbean islands. Recently, the incidence of human infections has increased rapidly. Most reports of the disease are from Thailand and Taiwan with increasing reports from mainland China. The rapid global spread of the parasite and the emerging occurrence of the infection pose challenges in clinical and laboratory diagnosis, and in epidemiology and basic biology. Enhanced understanding of the epidemiology of angiostrongyliasis, increased public awareness about the risks associated with eating raw or undercooked food, and enhanced food safety measures are needed. Therefore, current knowledge on various aspects of the parasite and the disease it causes, as well as recent epidemiological status together with significant progress in laboratory investigation of A. cantonensis infection, are overviewed to promote understanding and awareness of this emerging neglected disease."

The main objective of this paper is to estimate the endemic diffusion of hepatitis C at the national level and by geographical area, with an extrapolation at the regional level and by uniform cohorts of subjects (by sex and year of birth). The secondary objective is a stratification by gravity of the estimated statistical figures to provide an overview of possible targets of the new anti-HCV treatments. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant Italian populations studies regarding HCV prevalence. Random and fixed effect models were used for pooling data. To develop the epidemiological model, a meta-analysis of studies of Italian populations and the explicit consideration of the changes in the etiology of the disease in different cohorts (by year of birth) of population and the impact of effective treatments that have been introduced since the 1990s. A Markovian transition model, which is based on the distribution of HCV+ and HCV Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)+ subjects, provides a plausible assessment of the Italian situation.

In 2014, 1569,215 HCV+ subjects (95% credible interval [CrI]: 1202,630-2021,261) were estimated in Italy, with a 2.58% prevalence (95% CrI: 1.98%-3.33%). A total of 828,884 HCV RNA+ subjects (95% CrI: 615,892-1081,123), which is equal to a 1.36% prevalence (95% CrI: 1.01%-1.78%), is higher in southern Italy and the islands (1.9%) than in central-northern Italy (1.1%). The predominance of adult and elderly subjects, with an old or very old infection, inevitably entails a significant number of HCV RNA+ subjects in the advanced stages of the illness. According to our estimates, approximately 400,000 subjects have cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma, with a median age of 70 years. The model aims to support policymakers to define action plans by providing an estimate of both the emerged infected population and nonemerged infected population by age, gender, gravity, genotype, and geographical area.

Genotype 3 strains, mainly from sub-genotype 3f, circulated among swine livestock and certain wild mammals, and would be sporadically transmitted to humans through direct contact with the reservoirs or by consumption of foods derived from them. Bivalve shellfish contaminated by hepatitis E virus from sewage could also play a role in transmission. Although the interpretation of results from seroprevalence studies in low endemic settings is still controversial, antibody to hepatitis E virus displays an overall prevalence less than 10% among the population of Spain, increasing significantly with age. From the, approximately, 150 cases of acute hepatitis E recorded in the international literature, males older than 40 years, suffering a mild, locally atquired disease predominate. In addition, hepatitis E might be more frequent in the North of the country than in other regions. Although the disease does not usually have a great clinical relevance, the occasional finding of cases of fulminant hepatitis, and of ribavirin-resistant, chronic hepatitis E virus infections among the immunocompromised would recommend the surveillance of the infection by the public health authority and a better implementation of specific diagnostic procedures in clinical laboratories.

Infectious encephalitis and immune-mediated encephalitis share similar clinical signs and symptoms. The latter accounts for a significant proportion of presumably infectious encephalitis cases without any established etiological diagnosis; as shown from a prospective cohort study where 21% of cases were due to an immune cause. Several infectious agents are frequently reported in all studies: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most frequent pathogen in 65% of studies, followed by Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in several studies. Enteroviruses are also reported; being the most frequent viruses in two studies, and the 2nd or 3rd viruses in five other studies. There are important regional differences, especially in case of vector-borne transmission: Asia and the Japanese encephalitis virus, Eastern and Northern Europe/Eastern Russia and the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Northern America and Flavivirus or Alphavirus. Bacteria can also be incriminated: Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes are the most frequent, after HSV and VZV, in a French prospective study. The epidemiology of encephalitis is constantly evolving. Epidemiological data may indicate the emergence and/or dissemination of new causative agents. The dissemination and emergence of causative agents are fostered by environmental, social, and economical changes, but prevention programs (vaccination, vector controls) help reduce the incidence of other infectious diseases and associated encephalitis (e.g., measles).

Dogs are considered the major host for these parasites, and the main reservoir for human visceral infection. Parasites are transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies, being Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. ariasi the proven vectors in Portugal. The global climate changes associated with a higher density and activity of sand flies during a larger period might enhance the number of days favorable for transmission of parasites to humans and animals with a concomitant increase of incidence. In our country, as in other countries in the south of Europe, visceral leishmaniasis was initially a pediatric disease but in the last years the number of cases in children has decreased with an increase of infection in adults, normally associated with HIV/AIDS. Between 2000 and 2009, 173 new cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (66 in immunocompetent adults and children and 107 in immunocompromised patients) were observed in the Leishmaniasis Unit - IHMT. After the introduction of antiretroviral therapy HAART for HIV, the number of co-infected cases reported from southern Europe has fallen dramatically in all countries except in Portugal. In this country the number of co-infection new cases did not decrease-neither the frequent relapses. Despite cutaneous leishmaniasis being barely known in Portugal, it should not be considered as a rare disease since about ten new cases per year are diagnosed. In addition, canine leishmaniasis has increased with a prevalence rate up to 20% found in endemic foci. In 2008 the Portuguese National Leishmaniasis Observatory was created. The development of national and international epidemiological networks will help the knowledge of leishmaniasis and will promote opportunities to advise health authorities about the most effective measures for prevention and control of this parasitosis. These networking initiatives and, importantly their integration, will, hopefully, contribute towards a significant reduction of the incidence/prevalence of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis."

An increasing concern towards West Nile disease (WND) has been observed due to the high number of human and animal cases reported in these areas confirming the importance of this zoonosis. Anew epidemiological scenario is currently emerging: although new introductions of the virus from abroad are always possible, confirming the epidemiological role played by migratory birds, the infection endemisation in some European territories today is a reality supported by the constant reoccurrence of the same strains across years in the same geographical areas. Despite the WND reoccurrence in the Old World, the overwintering mechanisms are not well known, and the role of local resident birds or mosquitoes in this context is poorly understood. A recent new epidemiological scenario is the spread of lineage 2 strain across European and Mediterranean countries in regions where lineage 1 strain is still circulating creating favourable conditions for genetic reassortments and emergence of new strains. This paper summarizes the main epidemiological findings on WNV occurrence in Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin from 2009 to 2013, considering potential future spread patterns."

The major virulence factors of Shigatoxins-producing E. coli are encoded by a pathogenesis island, the locus of enterocyte effacement involved in the attaching and effacing lesion formation and in diarrhoea and the Shigatoxins encoded by bacteriophages and involved in extra-intestinal syndromes. The O157: H7 serotype STEC strain is responsible for outbreaks worldwide causing thousands of ills and tens of deaths. Numerous diagnosis methods were developed to identify this pathogen from food. They include classical bacteriological, immunological and molecular methods. Hygiene control is particularly important to avoid animal contamination in farms and meat contamination in slaughterhouse. Finally, risk assessment models have been developed in order to study the behaviour of STEC in the food chain."

Understanding how the diet of an ecologically important mesopredator varies throughout a large region can provide an insight into the trophic responses of generalist carnivores to global change. We review the diet of the red fox Vulpes vulpes in Europe. 2. The main aims of this study were: (1) to identify biogeographical patterns in red fox diet throughout Europe; (2) to investigate the significance of the human footprint index (a measure of anthropogenic influence on habitats) for the Europe- wide food habits of red foxes; and (3) to discuss the ecosystem role of red foxes in the face of global change. 3. We hypothesised that in the red fox: (1) diet composition is likely to vary along a latitudinal gradient, between seasons (pooled into warm and cold periods of the year), and in relation to human impact on habitats; and (2) dietary breadth will increase with latitude and be greater during the warm period than during the cold period. We conducted a Europe- wide analysis of red fox diet, using data from 66 studies in 17 European countries. Multivariate analysis and generalised linear models were used to evaluate variation in diet composition and niche breadth in relation to latitude, season, and human footprint index. 4. The analysis revealed that red fox diet composition varies considerably in response to latitude, human influence, and warm and cold periods. Dietary breadth decreases at higher latitudes in the cold period, but not in the warm period, and increases in areas with high human impact. Among individual dietary items, the consumption of lagomorphs is more frequent in areas with higher human footprint index. The occurrence of rodents and birds in fox diet increases uniformly with latitude, while that of plants and invertebrates responds differently to latitude in the warm and cold periods. 5. With climate warming, red foxes may incorporate a wider spectrum of food categories into their diet in northern areas in the future. Widening of fox dietary niche breadth could have important consequences for ecosystems and for the spread of zoonotic diseases."

Of these, four M. daubentonii (3.5796 of submitted M. daubentonii) were positive for EBLV-2. Potential bias in the passive surveillance includes possible over-representation of synanthropic species and regional biases caused by varying bat submission numbers from different parts of the UK. In 2003, active surveillance in the UK began, and has detected an antibody prevalence level of 1-5% of EBLV-2 in M. daubentonii (n = 350), and one bat with antibodies to EBLV-1 in E. serotinus (n = 52).

This framework helps to determine how health systems and pandemic programmes interact, whether, where and which weak points exist, and how and where pandemic response health programmes can be improved effectively. This new conceptual framework draws upon two existing approaches for assessment and evaluation, the Systemic Rapid Assessment Toolkit (SYSRA) and the Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). SYSRA is a systematic approach to analyse the interplay between communicable disease programmes and the broader health systems context within which they operate and the HACCP methodology builds upon a systematic analysis of process steps within a programme in order to identify likely hazards and to develop control measures to address them. The analytical framework that we have developed from the novel conceptualisation is simple, can be applied rapidly, and should, we believe, be low cost to implement. Thus, this provides a means for developing a contextual understanding of the broader health system in which a pandemic infectious disease programme operates, and for identifying frailties in programmes that need robe responded to.

Currently, almost 30 of the 42 million people infected with HIV worldwide live in Africa. AIDS in humans is caused by two lentiviruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, which entered the human population by zoonotic transmissions from at least two different African primate species. Extensive phylogenetic analyses of partial and full-length genome sequences have helped to gain insights into the evolutionary biology and population dynamics of HIV. One of the major characteristics of HIV is its rapid evolution, which has resulted in substantial genetic diversity amongst different isolates, the majority of which are represented in Africa. Genetic variability of HIV and any consequent phenotypic variation poses a significant challenge to disease control and surveillance in different geographic regions of Africa. This review focuses on the origins and evolution of HIV, current classification and diversity of HIV isolates in Africa and provides an extensive account of the geographic distribution of HIV types, groups, and subtypes in each of the 49 African countries. Numerous epidemiological studies have provided a picture of HIV distribution patterns in most countries in Africa, and these show increasing evidence of the importance of HIV-1 recombinants. In particular, this review highlights that our current understanding of HIV distribution in Africa is incomplete and inadequately represents the diversity of the virus, and underscores the need for ongoing surveillance."

We use the concept of epidemiological transition to understand changing ecological relationships between humans, pathogens and other disease insults. With the Paleolithic period as a baseline, we begin with ecological and social relationships that minimized the impact of infectious disease. Paleolithic populations would have retained many of the pathogens that they shared with their primate ancestors and would have been exposed to zoonoses that they picked up as they adapted to a foraging existence. The sparse mobile populations would have precluded the existence of endemic infectious disease. About 10,000 years ago, the shift to an agricultural subsistence economy created the first epidemiological transition, marked by the emergence of infections, a pattern that has continued to the present. Beginning about a century ago, some populations have undergone a second epidemiological transition in which public health measures, improved nutrition and medicine resulted in declines in infectious disease and a rise in non-infectious, chronic and degenerative diseases. Human populations are entering the third epidemiological transition in which there is a reemergence of infectious diseases previously thought to be under control, and the emergence of novel diseases. Many of the emerging and reemerging pathogens are antibiotic resistant and some are multi-antibiotic resistant. Inequality continues to widen within and between societies, accelerating the spread of emerging and reemerging diseases. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Each year, the Health authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in coordination with international health authorities, updates health requirements for pilgrims. The Hajj for 2017 took place from August 24 to September 5, 2017. Here, we review the expected obligations for immunizations for the 2018 Hajj and Umrah. Results: The Hajj and Umrah vaccine requirements include mandatory vaccinations against yellow fever, quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide (every 3 years) or conjugated (every 5 years) vaccines and poliomyelitis vaccine. Influenza vaccine utilizing the 2016 (Southern Hemisphere vaccine to all pilgrims) was recommended but was not obligatory for pilgrims. Ciprofloxacin is required for individuals > 12 years excluding pregnant women as chemoprophylaxis to be given at the port of entry for Pilgrims coming from the meningitis belt. With the ongoing outbreaks of measles in Europe, it is recommended that all pilgrims have an updated immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles and mumps). Conclusion: The mandatory vaccines remain the same with continued vigilance for the development of any new or emerging infectious diseases. Continuing surveillance for Zika virus, cholera and MERS-CoV are ongoing."

Dendrimers, a specific class of monodisperse macromolecules, have recently shown potential to function as both antibacterial agents and antimicrobial surface coatings. This review discusses the limitations with currently used antibacterial agents and describes how various classes of dendrimers, including glycodendrimers, cationic dendrimers, anionic dendrimers, and peptide dendrimers, have the potential to improve upon or replace certain antibiotics.

With E. coli as a major opportunistic pathogen in chickens and with a potential for zoonotic transfer to human beings, ESBL-producing E. coli represents a major risk both to poultry production and to human health. This review presents some of the current problems with ESBL-producing E. coli in relation to poultry production, with a focus on chickens. To illustrate issues in relation to screening and typing, two case studies are included where one collection of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates was obtained from asymptomatic carrier chickens while the other was obtained from lesions in chickens. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequence typing revealed a highly heterogeneous population of ESBL-producing E. coli. All isolates harboured between one and three large plasmids (>100 kb). Among isolates associated with asymptomatic chickens, the ESBL types SHV and TEM dominated, while CTX-M-1 dominated in disease-associated isolates. The isolates from diseased birds were occasionally of sequence types often associated with human infections, such as ST131. With improved tools to trace and screen for ESBL-producing E. coli at farm level, strategies can be selected that aim to reduce or eliminate the presence of ESBL-producing E. coli in poultry and poultry products meant for human consumption."

Dysfunction in the adipose tissue response to storing excess fatty acids as triglyceride can lead to adipose tissue inflammation and spillover of fatty acids from this tissue and accumulation of fatty acids as lipid droplets in ectopic sites, such as liver and muscle. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from adipocytes and have been proposed to be involved in adipocyte/macrophage cross talk and to affect insulin signaling and transforming growth factor beta expression in liver cells leading to metabolic disease. Furthermore EV produced by adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) can promote angiogenesis and cancer cell migration and have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties. ADSC EVs have therapeutic potential in vascular and neurodegenerative disease and may also be used to target specific functional miRNAs to cells. Obesity is associated with an increase in adipose-derived EV which may be related to the metabolic complications of obesity.

The concepts of droplet and airborne transmission that are entrenched in clinical practice have recently been shown to be more complex than previously thought. Several randomised clinical trials of facemasks have been conducted in community and healthcare settings, using widely varying interventions, including mixed interventions (such as masks and handwashing), and diverse outcomes. Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance. Two trials in healthcare workers favoured respirators for clinical respiratory illness. The use of reusable cloth masks is widespread globally, particularly in Asia, which is an important region for emerging infections, but there is no clinical research to inform their use and most policies offer no guidance on them. Health economic analyses of facemasks are scarce and the few published cost effectiveness models do not use clinical efficacy data. The lack of research on facemasks and respirators is reflected in varied and sometimes conflicting policies and guidelines. Further research should focus on examining the efficacy of facemasks against specific infectious threats such as influenza and tuberculosis, assessing the efficacy of cloth masks, investigating common practices such as reuse of masks, assessing compliance, filling in policy gaps, and obtaining cost effectiveness data using clinical efficacy estimates."

It has been reported that the AIV H9N2 donated its internal genes for the devastating 1997 Hong Kong outbreak and furthermore, it may be the cause of the next influenza pandemic. There are many factors such as its wide host range, ability to cross the species barrier, ecological diversity, antiviral resistance and zoonotic importance that make it an excellent candidate for the next influenza pandemic.

Consequently, there exists a unique opportunity to exploit these molecules for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of human pro- and auto-inflammatory disorders (for example septic shock, transplant rejection and autoimmune disease). In this review, we describe the mechanisms used by the trematode parasite, Fasciola hepatica, to modulate the immune responses of its host and discuss the potent immune-modulatory effects of three individual molecules within the secretome; namely cathepsin L1, peroxiredoxin and helminth defence molecule. With a focus on the requirements from industry, we discuss the strategies by which these molecules may be clinically developed to control human immune responses in a way that is conducive to the prevention of immune-mediated diseases.

However, the increasing importance of human fascioliasis worldwide has re-launched interest in fascioliasis. From the 1990s, many new concepts have been developed regarding human fascioliasis and these have furnished a new baseline for the human disease that is very different to a simple extrapolation from fascioliasis in livestock. Studies have shown that human fascioliasis presents marked heterogeneity, including different epidemiological situations and transmission patterns in different endemic areas. This heterogeneity, added to the present emergence/re-emergence of the disease both in humans and animals in many regions, confirms a worrying global scenario. The huge negative impact of fascioliasis on human communities demands rapid action. When analyzing how better to define control measures for endemic areas differing at such a level, it would be useful to have genetic markers that could distinguish each type of transmission pattern and epidemiological situation. Accordingly, this chapter covers aspects of aetiology, geographical distribution, epidemiology, transmission and control in order to obtain a solid baseline for the interpretation of future results. The origins and geographical spread of F. hepatica and F. gigantica in both the ruminant pre-domestication times and the livestock post-domestication period are analyzed. Paleontological, archaeological and historical records, as well as genetic data on recent dispersal of livestock species, are taken into account to establish an evolutionary framework for the two fasciolids across all continents. Emphasis is given to the distributional overlap of both species and the roles of transportation, transhumance and trade in the different overlap situations. Areas with only one Fasciola spp. are distinguished from local and zonal overlaps in areas where both fasciolids co-exist. Genetic techniques applied to liver flukes in recent years that are useful to elucidate the genetic characteristics of the two fasciolids are reviewed. The intra-specific and interspecific variabilities of 'pure' F hepatica and 'pure' F gigantica were ascertained by means of complete sequences of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-2 and ITS-1 and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) cox1 and nad1 from areas with only one fasciolid species. Fasciolid sequences of the same markers scattered in the literature are reviewed. The definitive haplotypes established appear to fit the proposed global evolutionary scenario. Problems posed by fasciolid cross-breeding, introgression and hybridization in overlap areas are analyzed. Nuclear rDNA appears to correlate with adult fluke characteristics and fasciolid/lymnaeid specificity, whereas mtDNA does not. However, flukes sometimes appear so intermediate that they cannot be ascribed to either F hepatica-like or F. gigantica-like forms and snail specificity may be opposite to the one deduced from the adult morphotype. The phenotypic characteristics of adults and eggs of 'pure' F. hepatica and F. gigantica, as well as of intermediate forms in overlap areas, are compared, with emphasis on the definitive host influence on egg size in humans. Knowledge is sufficient to support F. hepatica and F. gigantica as two valid species, which recently diverged by adaptation to different pecoran and lymnaeid hosts inareas with differing environmental characteristics. Their phenotypic differences and ancient pre-domestication origins involve a broad geographical area that largely exceeds the typical, more local scenarios known for sub-species units. Phenomena such as abnormal ploidy and aspermic parthenogenesis in hybrids suggest that their separate evolution in pre-domestication times allowed them to achieve almost total genetic isolation. Recent sequencing results suggest that present assumptions on fasciolid-lymnaeid specificity might be wrong. The crucial role of lymnaeids in fascioliasis transmission, epidemiology and control was the reason for launching a worldwide lymnaeid molecular characterization initiative. This initiative has already furnished useful results on several continents. A standardized methodology for fasciolids and lymnaeids is proposed herein in order that future work is undertaken on a comparable basis. A complete understanding of molecular epidemiology is expected to help greatly in designing global actions and local interventions for control of fascioliasis."

However, since the identification of the first autochthonous hepatitis E case and hepatitis E viremic domestic pigs in Japan in 2001, our understanding of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in this country has been changing markedly. This has largely been due to the development of serological and gene-based diagnostic assays, the accumulation of molecular epidemiological findings on HEV infection in humans and animals (as potential reservoirs for HEV in humans) and the recognition of the importance of zoonotic food-borne and other routes of transmission of HEV, including blood-borne transmission. Although it is now evident that autochthonous hepatitis E in Japan is far more common than was previously thought, clinical and subclinical HEV infections indigenous to Japan remain underdiagnosed and their prevalence is still underestimated due to the presence of unknown transmission routes and a low awareness of the infection status by many physicians in Japan. This review focuses on the features of HEV infection in humans and animals, as definitive or potential reservoirs for HEV, in Japan, and updates the current knowledge on the routes of transmission, including zoonotic routes, which are important for the maintenance and spread of HEV in Japan."

Cats are the major reservoir of Bartonella henselae, B. clarridgeiae and B. koehlerae which are transmitted to humans, while they are accidental host of B. quintana, B. bovis Kat B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. The pathogen is transmitted among cats mainly by fleas while other vectors are also suspicious for transmission since the bacteria have been isolated from ticks and flies. The bacterial pathogenicity may be emphasized by the strain of the bacterium and the immune status of the infected host. Most of the infected cats remain asymptomatic. In the natural occurring cases of feline bartonellosis uveitis, chronic gingivostomatitis and endocarditis have been reported. Mild anemia and leucocytosis in the early phase of the infection has been also reported. Diagnosis is based on the detection of the specific anti-bartonella antibodies by the inderict immunofluorescent test, ELISA and Western blot assays. Molecular biology techniques mainly PCR, cytology, histopathology and blood culture have also been employed for the direct detection of the pathogen. Prolonged antimicrobial therapy results to the reduction of bacterial burden without total elimination of the pathogen. Bartonella henselae is the causative agent of cat scratch disease, a human infection usually characterized by persistent regional lymphadenopathy and less frequently fever while angiomatosis or hepatic peliosis have been reported mainly in immunocompromised patients. It is transmitted to humans by cat scratches or bites. The most effective means of protection is regular flea control. Additionally, commonsense precautions and hygiene such as washing hands after handling pets and clean any cats and bites or scratches promptly are recommended especially in population at great risk."

Streptomycin or gentamycin (for 10-14 days) are the first choise antibiotics for the treatment. Tularemia becomes a reemerging zoonosis in Turkey. The first published tularemia epidemic in Turkey had been reported in 1936 from Thrace region (Luleburgaz town), and the second was in 1945 again in the same location. In recent years, tularemia outbreaks were reported from various regions of Turkey. The reliable data were obtained after 2005 because of the inclusion of this infection into Group C of notification system of communicable diseases by Turkish Ministry of Health. A total of 431 confirmed cases were reported from various provinces according to data of the year 2005. In this review, general characteristics of F.tularensis and its infections have been discussed emphasizing the data related with tularemia in Turkey."

F. tularensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that infects and replicates in vivo mainly inside macrophages. During its systemic dissemination, F. tularensis must cope with very different life conditions (such as survival in different target organs or tissues and/or survival in the blood stream...) and may thus encounter a broad variety of carbon substrates, nitrogen, phosphor, and sulfur sources, as well as very low concentrations of essential ions. The development of recent genome-wide genetic screens have led to the identification of hundreds of genes participating to variable extents to Francisella virulence. Remarkably, an important proportion of the genes identified are related to metabolic and nutritional functions. However, the relationship between nutrition and the in vivo life cycle of F. tularensis is yet poorly understood. In this review, we will address the importance of metabolism and nutrition for F. tularensis pathogenesis, focusing specifically on amino acid and carbohydrate requirements."

Most often, Yersinia pestis bacteria have been maintained and circulating at low levels in the rodent populations. It seems therefore more appropriate to speak in terms of expansion or regression phases for sylvatic rodent plague foci and to reserve the term re-emergence for human cases. From the analysis of well-documented human plague cases in Madagascar, we underline the causes of re-emergence that can be generalized to most world foci, and can help define environments at risk where the threat of new emergence lurks. In all recent plague outbreaks, usually more than one risk factor was at the origin of the re-emergence. The reduction or discontinuance of surveillance and control, as well as poverty and insalubrity are the main factors in the re-emergence of human cases, allowing increased contacts with infected rodents and fleas. Environment changes (i.e. climatic changes, deforestation, urbanization) induce changes in flea and rodent populations by (i) extension of rodent habitats ( for example by replacing forests by steppes or farmlands); (ii) modifications in population dynamics ( possible outbreaks due to an increase of available food resources); but also, (iii) emergence of new vectors, reservoirs and new Y. pestis genotypes. Numerous and spontaneous genomic rearrangements occur at high frequencies in Y. pestis, which may confer selective advantages, enhancing the ability of Y. pestis to survive, to be transmitted to new hosts, and to colonize new environments. Therefore, any environmental change should be taken as a warning signal and active surveillance programs should be initiated."

In addition, influenza A zoonotic viruses are a constant pandemic threat. These viruses present two major surface glycoproteins: the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). These two glycoproteins both recognize the sialic acid and have complementary activities, the HA binds the sialic acid through its receptor-binding site, the NA is a receptor-destroying enzyme that cleaves alpha 2-3 and alpha 2-6-linked sialic acids. Therefore, the functional HA/NA balance is a critical factor for a good viral fitness and plays a major role in overcoming the host barrier and the efficiency of sustained human-to-human transmission. Although the two glycoproteins are in constant evolution, the HA/NA balance seems to remain stable in human viruses because an optimal balance is required to maintain good viral fitness. Understanding the evolution of influenza viruses requires an in-depth exploration of the HA/NA balance. (C) 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Bananas, mangos, several nuts, spices, coffee, and cacao are widely traded and much sought after around the world. However, the sustainable production of these tropical tree fruit crops faces significant challenges. Among these, losses due to pests and diseases play a large part in reducing yields, quality, and profitability. Using bananas and cacao as key examples, we outline some of the reasons fungal and oomycete diseases cause such significant losses to tropical tree crops. Cultivation of monocultures derived from limited genetic diversity, environmental conditions conducive for disease development, high levels of disease incidence and severity, a lack of disease resistance in planting materials, shortages of labor, and inadequate infrastructure and investment pose significant challenges, especially for smallholder producers. The expansion of travel and trade has given rise to emerging infectious plant diseases that add further insecurity and pressure. We conclude that holistic actions are needed on multiple fronts to address the growing problem of disease in tropical fruit tree crops."

Fungi interact with insects and spiders very diversely, ranging from physiologically necessary to entomopathogen. Raw arthropods, usually collected from their original environment, may carry a variety of fungi of which some have the potential to cause disease also in humans (e.g. Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Mucor spp. and Aureobasidium pullulans) and may act as food spoilers. Regarding mycosis, most of these pathogens have been reported only as sporadic opportunists affecting immunocompromised patients. This however is also true for other foodstuffs. A more intensive usage of edible arthropods (especially of insects) is intended for the future, and so, proper hygienic means must be undertaken to ensure consumers' safety.

Dairy production systems are considered as important sources of greenhouse gas emissions; however, little is known about the sensitivity and vulnerability of these production systems themselves to climate warming. This review brings different aspects of dairy cow production in Central Europe into focus, with a holistic approach to emphasize potential future consequences and challenges arising from climate change. With the current understanding of the effects of climate change, it is expected that yield of forage per hectare will be influenced positively, whereas quality will mainly depend on water availability and soil characteristics. Thus, the botanical composition of future grassland should include species that are able to withstand the changing conditions (e. g. lucerne and bird's foot trefoil). Changes in nutrient concentration of forage plants, elevated heat loads and altered feeding patterns of animals may influence rumen physiology. Several promising nutritional strategies are available to lower potential negative impacts of climate change on dairy cow nutrition and performance. Adjustment of feeding and drinking regimes, diet composition and additive supplementation can contribute to the maintenance of adequate dairy cow nutrition and performance. Provision of adequate shade and cooling will reduce the direct effects of heat stress. As estimated genetic parameters are promising, heat stress tolerance as a functional trait may be included into breeding programmes. Indirect effects of global warming on the health and welfare of animals seem to be more complicated and thus are less predictable. As the epidemiology of certain gastrointestinal nematodes and liver fluke is favourably influenced by increased temperature and humidity, relations between climate change and disease dynamics should be followed closely. Under current conditions, climate change associated economic impacts are estimated to be neutral if some form of adaptation is integrated. Therefore, it is essential to establish and adopt mitigation strategies covering available tools from management, nutrition, health and plant and animal breeding to cope with the future consequences of climate change on dairy farming."

We reviewed all reported cases of visceral basidiobolomycosis with special focus on the gastrointestinal involvement in children. Twenty-six cases of GIB have been reported worldwide, in 14 adults and 12 children. All cases presented with fever, abdominal pain with mass and high blood eosinophilia and were misdiagnosed as other chronic granulomatous diseases or malignancies. A few cases of retroperitoneal, pulmonary, nasal and disseminated basidiobolomycosis have also been reported. Basidiobolomycosis mostly affects young males as a subcutaneous infection. The visceral form of infection is rare. GIB has been scarcely reported in the medical literature, but recently it has been increasingly recognized. GIB poses diagnostic difficulties. Abdominal pain with mass and eosinophilia were present in all cases, highlighting the necessity of considering GIB in the differential diagnosis of this presentation. B. ranarum has been reported to cause disseminated fatal disease in both immune-competent and -compromised individuals. Culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but the characteristic histopathological picture of chronic granulomas rich in eosinophils and the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon are the usual diagnostic tools. Surgery plus long courses of itraconazole treatment, up to 1 year, appear to be the best management options. GIB is an emerging infection that might lead to diagnostic confusion, morbidity and mortality.

In most of the cases, the same animal species or genera were considered in both the zoos. One or more intestinal parasites were detected in 61.5% of the examined samples. However, very different percentages of protozoa- and helminth-positive samples were obtained in the animals from the two zoos, with an overall gastrointestinal parasitic infection of 77.1% in the Zoo Safari of Fasano and 36.7% in the Giardino Zoologico or Pistoia. Overall, 10% (Cryptosporidium sp.) and 43.3% (Toxocara can, Strongyloides stercoralis, Toxascaris leonina, and hookworms) of carnivores, 66.7% (Cryptosporidium spp.) and 100% (Trichuris spp. and Strongyloides fulleborni) of primates, 25.0% (Eimeria spp., Cryptosporidium spp.), and 57.1% (Trichuris sp., Toxocara [Neoascaris] vitulorum, gastrointestinal strongyles, and Paramphistomidae) of artiodactyls were infected with protozoa and helminthes parasites, respectively. Only gastrointestinal strongyles were diagnosed in 16.7% of proboscideans and in 50.0% of perissodactyls examined. The results of this study suggest that zoonotic protozoans and gastrointestinal helminths are common in zoo mammals and that these animals may serve as a potential reservoir and transmit these parasites to humans. The different animal management in the two zoos indicates that the regular monitoring of parasitic diseases and the use of selective treatments can represent effective measures for the control of several gastrointestinal infections in zoological gardens."

The impact of cryptosporidiosis is also compounded by the spread of HIV/AIDS and a lack of cost-effective anti-cryptosporidial chemotherapeutics or vaccines. Mitigation of the impact of cryptosporidiosis in humans needs to focus on prevention and control strategies, built on a sound understanding of the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium species. Refined epidemiological studies rely on the use of molecular tools employing informative genetic markers. Currently, the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene (gp60) is the most suitable and widely used genetic marker for Cryptosporidium species infecting humans. Here, we undertake an analysis of all publicly-available gp60 sequence data and associated literature for C. hominis and C. parvum, and yield useful insights into the richness, diversity and distribution of genetic variants, and link these variants to human cryptosporidiosis. This global analysis reveals that, despite high genetic richness in Cryptosporidium isolates from humans, there is a surprisingly low diversity. It also highlights limited knowledge about the genetics of cryptosporidiosis in developing nations and in many animals that might act as infection sources. Clearly, there is a major need for more comprehensive studies of Cryptosporidium infecting humans and other animals in Africa and Asia. As molecular technologies improve and become affordable, future studies should utilize ""next generation"" sequencing and bioinformatic platforms to conduct comparative 'genome sequence surveys' to test the validity of current genetic classifications based on gp60 data.

Using the case of Buruli ulcer disease, we review how land-use changes, climatic patterns and biodiversity alterations contribute to disease emergence in many parts of the world. Here we clearly show that Mycobacterium ulcerans is an environmental pathogen characterized by multi-host transmission dynamics and that its infectious pathways to humans rely on the local effects of global environmental changes. We show that the interplay between habitat changes (for example, deforestation and agricultural land-use changes) and climatic patterns (for example, rainfall events), applied in a local context, can lead to abiotic environmental changes and functional changes in local biodiversity that favor the pathogen's prevalence in the environment and may explain disease emergence."

Due to their high prevalence in dairy and beef cattle, farms are considered to be potential sources of transmission of the parasites to surrounding bodies of water. Additionally, human sewage overflow events can also contaminate nearby water sources. Both protozoa have been detected in various species of shellfish, but a lack of consistency in methods for detection and viability assessments make it difficult to compare data and extrapolate results. Nonetheless, the detection of these parasites in shellfish destined for human consumption is necessary due to the public health risk that these parasites pose. There is currently no legislation requiring public health officials to test for these parasites in potentially contaminated shellfish or water, despite the increasing evidence suggesting the need to implement parasitological analyses. Furthermore, standard depuration procedures are ineffective at inactivating the parasites, and even supplementation with ultraviolet radiation requires extensive periods of depuration to effectively inactivate all (oo)cysts from bivalves. Although there have been no official reports of human gastroenteritis acquired from consuming shellfish contaminated with Cryptosporidium sp. and/or G. duodenalis, studies examining the efficacy of current monitoring and depuration standards in Canada are needed in the event that they are inadequate for the removal of potentially harmful protozoan parasites.

Over the last 5 years, new vaccines protecting against these bacteria have been developed and introduced in various countries. Areas covered: This review describes the recently licensed glycoconjugates being used to protect against these encapsulated bacteria. Immunogenicity and safety data that led to licensure or licensure expansion of these glycoconjugates are discussed in addition to the resultant impact on the disease burden. Expert opinion: The maintenance of robust immunisation programmes with high uptake rates is important in maintaining low rates of disease. Epidemiological surveillance systems are essential in monitoring any changes in infectious disease trends and in identifying emerging infections such as from non-typeable H. influenzae, pneumococcal serotype replacement disease and changes in the epidemiology of meningococcal serogroups. This is important to guide future vaccine development. Accessibility of these glycoconjugate vaccines in resource poor regions, which bear the highest disease burden from these pathogens, remains challenging largely due to high vaccine pricing.

Over a decade ago, ESGEM, the ESCMID (Europen Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases) Study Group on Epidemiological Markers, produced guidelines for optimal use and quality assessment of the then most frequently used typing procedures. We present here an update of these guidelines, taking into account the spectacular increase in the number and quality of typing methods made available over the past decade. Newer and older, phenotypic and genotypic methods for typing of all clinically relevant bacterial species are described according to their principles, advantages and disadvantages. Criteria for their evaluation and application and the interpretation of their results are proposed. Finally, the issues of reporting, standardisation, quality assessment and international networks are discussed. It must be emphasised that typing results can never stand alone and need to be interpreted in the context of all available epidemiological, clinical and demographical data relating to the infectious disease under investigation. A strategic effort on the part of all workers in the field is thus mandatory to combat emerging infectious diseases, as is financial support from national and international granting bodies and health authorities."

Several rodent-borne hantaviruses cause two diseases that share many features in humans, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas. It is thought that the immune response plays a significant contributory role in these diseases. However, in reservoir hosts that have been closely examined, little or no pathology occurs and infection is persistent despite evidence of adaptive immune responses. Because most hantavirus reservoirs are not model organisms, it is difficult to conduct meaningful experiments that might shed light on how the viruses evade sterilizing immune responses and why immunopathology does not occur. Despite these limitations, recent advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics will have a dramatic impact on understanding reservoir host responses to hantaviruses by employing a systems biology approach to identify important pathways that mediate virus/reservoir relationships."

Humans may get the disease by contamination with excreta of carrier rodents. The disease typically manifests with the triad fever-thrombocytopenia-acute kidney injury (AKI). Although its global prevalence seems to be increasing, Hantavirus infection is still commonly overlooked, because of its clinical polymorphism and non-specific symptoms, particularly in mild cases. Until recently, the disease was virtually unknown in Romania, due to lack of physicians' awareness and of adequate laboratory diagnostic techniques. In this article, we present the first six cases of HFRS diagnosed in our country, based on serology testing. We review the existing literature on HFRS and discuss our findings in comparison with other reports. All our patients presented with fever, flu syndrome, bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, and oliguria. Among laboratory abnormalities, elevated serum creatinine and liver enzymes, high C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, low platelet count, and hematuria were constantly seen. Five patients required hemodialysis. All patients survived and five of them completely recovered their renal function, while only one patient retained a mild impairment of the glomerular filtration rate. From a clinical viewpoint, we believe that Hantavirus infection should be considered in all patients presenting with fever, thrombocytopenia, and AKI, when specific serology testing would be indicated. From a public health perspective, we suggest that future efforts in our country should be directed toward (1) increasing the understanding and the awareness of this disease among health care professionals, (2) educating the population at risk on the application of prophylactic measures, (3) expanding the availability of diagnostic laboratory tools, and (4) developing research on national zoonotic virus reservoirs."

However, there may be hazards associated with this consumption due to the presence of bacteria, parasites, biotoxins, and environmental contaminants. Reported health effects of consuming sea turtles infected with zoonotic pathogens include diarrhea, vomiting, and extreme dehydration, which occasionally have resulted in hospitalization and death. Levels of heavy metals and organochlorine compounds measured in sea turtle edible tissues exceed international food safety standards and could result in toxic effects including neurotoxicity, kidney disease, liver cancer, and developmental effects in fetuses and children. The health data presented in this review provide information to health care providers and the public concerning the potential hazards associated with sea turtle consumption. Based on past mortality statistics from turtle poisonings, nursing mothers and children should be particularly discouraged from consuming all sea turtle products. We recommend that individuals choose seafood items lower in the food chain that may have a lower contaminant load. Dissemination of this information via a public health campaign may simultaneously improve public health and enhance sea turtle conservation by reducing human consumption of these threatened and endangered species."

Moreover, it causes zoonotic infections, producing pulmonary dirofilariasis in humans. Heartworm disease is a vector-borne transmitted disease, thus transmission depends on the presence of competent mosquito species, which is directly related to favorable climate conditions for its development and survival. Cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis is mainly located in countries with temperate and tropical climates. Europe is one of the continents where animal dirofilariasis has been studied more extensively. In this article we review the current prevalence of canine and feline cardiopulmonary dirofilanasis in the European continent, the transmission vectors, the current changes in the distribution and the possible causes, though the analysis of the epidemiological studies carried out until 2001 and between 2002 and 2011. The highest prevalences have been observed in the southern European countries, which are considered historically endemic/hyperendemic countries. Studies carried out in the last 10 years suggest an expansion of cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis in dogs toward central and northern Europe. Several factors can exert an influence on the spreading of the disease, such as movement of infected animals, the introduction of new species of mosquitoes able to act as vectors, the climate change caused by the global warming, and development of human activity in new areas. Veterinary controls to prevent the spreading of this disease, programs of control of vectors, and adequate protocols of prevention of dirofilariasis in the susceptible species should be carried out."

The waterborne epidemic of hepatitis in Delhi in 1955 was shown to be due to non-A-non-B aetiology, later confirmed as hepatitis E. Thereafter, a large number of epidemics of the disease have been reported from different parts of the country. Hepatitis E is the major cause of sporadic viral hepatitis among adults. High mortality among pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, and predilection for young adults remain the characteristic feature. However, the exact reasons remain unidentified. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an RNA virus belonging to a newly identified Hepeviridae family. The human HEV from India belongs to genotype-1 while pigs circulate genotype-4. So far, no zoonotic transmission is reported. The virus has been shown in water, sewage and soil samples. Faecal contamination of drinking water is the major source of HEV infection. Intrafamilial and parenteral transmissions are rare. The virus was transmitted to chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Highly sensitive and specific immunoassays have been developed for the detection of both IgM and IgG-anti-HEV antibodies. A clinical trial is awaited following the development of an effective recombinant protein-based vaccine. A significant reduction in hepatitis E was shown in pregnant women receiving human immunoglobulins. Several basic studies have thrown light on the role of different genes/proteins of the virus in the pathogenesis/replication of the virus."

Wild boar is deemed as the main HEV wildlife reservoir in these countries, but apart from Japan, the role deer play in HEV epidemiology is largely unknown. This review gives an overview on the current knowledge on HEV infection and disease in wild ungulates, the risk they pose for humans and the likely routes of zoonotic HEV transmission. The compiled information should serve for proposing future research, surveillance, prevention and control. Scientific evidence suggests it is likely that wild boar infect deer with HEV when they share the habitat. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) may need a source of infection, acting as spillover host more than as a true reservoir. However, both wild ungulates can serve as an HEV source for humans. In addition, few background data on wildlife population ecology is available from the reviewed literature, which hampers the identification of HEV risk factors in wild ungulates. There is also a lack of studies that connect HEV infection in wildlife and humans. Worldwide, several human cases of HEV infections are described, but knowledge on whether the consumption of infected animals leads to clinical disease in humans is largely lacking. To meet all these challenges, cross-collaborative studies involving medics and wildlife researchers are needed. This should be a global effort to allow research to make a step forward.

In this review, we aim to summarise studies on HEV with the aim of providing a further understanding of the epidemiology of the disease in Ghana. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by following the recommendations outlined in the PRISMA statement. Studies on HEV infection among Ghanaians were identified by searching for articles (published up until 4th August 2016) in the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, African Journals Online, Google Scholar and the WHO African Index Medicus databases. We also searched the websites of the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service to identify any related non-indexed studies. References of all retrieved studies were screened to identify additional publications. Results: Ten studies involving a total of 2 894 participants from six regions of Ghana were identified. The proportion of Ghanaians showing positive serological markers for HEV infection was within the range of 5.8-71.55%. In addition, 0.7-45.9% tested positive for IgM antibodies while the proportion of Ghanaians testing positive for IgG antibodies was within the range of 0-45.3%. One study reporting a case fatality rate of 66.7% among pregnant women was identified. No information on HEV genotypes was retrieved. Conclusions: Although based on a limited number of studies, this review does highlight that there is a high level of HEV infection among Ghanaians. Preventive measures including educational interventions as well as general improvements to sanitary and living conditions are needed to reduce the burden of the disease. Additionally, further research regarding the contribution of the various HEV genotypes is urgently needed to fully understand the burden of this disease in Ghana."

Despite challenges that exist when examining hormonal pathways in small-bodied hibernators, bats represent a potential model taxon for comparative neuro-endocrinological studies of hibernation due to their diversity of species and the reliance of many species on heterothermy. Understanding physiological mechanisms underlying hibernation in bats is also important from a conservation physiology perspective due to white-nose syndrome, an emerging infectious disease causing catastrophic mortality among hibernating bats in eastern North America.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are just two of the most widely reported recent emerging infectious diseases. What are the factors that contribute to the rapid evolution of viral species? Various hypotheses have been proposed, all involving opportunities for virus spread (for example, agricultural practices, climate changes, rainforest clearing or air travel). However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered a contributing factor to the emergence of infectious disease. In this review, we show that host nutritional status can influence not only the host response to the pathogen, but can also influence the genetic make-up of the viral genome. This latter finding markedly changes, our concept of host-pathogen interactions and creates a new paradigm for the study of such phenomena."

We synthesize the emerging solution to this paradox: phenotypic flexibility and phylogenetic conservatism in traits related to resource use, grouped under the term ecological fitting, provide substantial opportunities for rapid host switching in changing environments, in the absence of the evolution of novel host-utilization capabilities. We discuss mechanisms behind ecological fitting, its implications for defining specialists and generalists, and briefly review empirical examples of host shifts in the context of ecological fitting. We conclude that host shifts via ecological fitting provide the fuel for the expansion phase of the recently proposed oscillation hypothesis of host range and speciation, and, more generally, the generation of novel combinations of interacting species within the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. Finally, we conclude that taxon pulses, driven by climate change and large-scale ecological perturbation are drivers of biotic mixing and resultant ecological fitting, which leads to increased rates of rapid host switching, including the agents of Emerging Infectious Disease."

Plasmodium knowlesi, a parasite of the South-East Asian macaques (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca nemestrina), had entered the human population. Plasmodium knowlesi is transmitted by the leucosphyrus group of Anopheline mosquitoes and transmission is largely zoonotic and restricted to the jungle setting. Humans entering jungle transmission sites are at risk. Since 2004, human cases of P. knowlesi have been continuously reported in local communities and in travellers returning from South East Asia. Plasmodium knowlesi is the most common type of indigenous malaria reported in Malaysia. Infections are most often uncomplicated but at least 10% of patients report with severe malaria and 1-2% of cases have a fatal outcome. Parasitaemia is positively associated with the clinical and laboratory markers of severe malaria.

We present a causal web to map some important anthropogenic drivers (long-distance movement of live aquatic animals, large-scale movements of animal products and farming practices) via proximate causes to different types of emerging disease. 2. The long-distance movement of animals and their pathogens and parasites will directly lead to increased geographical distribution. In addition, the introduction of non-native species for aquaculture or as ornamental animals may promote host-switching through the mixing of pathogens and parasites with new hosts, driving the emergence of new diseases and known diseases in new hosts. The movement of animal products may drive disease emergence by the same processes, but the risks are lower. 3. The high stocking density found in many aquaculture systems and the relative genetic homogeneity of farm animals can increase disease prevalence. Generally, the overspill of pathogens into the environment is not prevented and in addition, farm or ornamental animals may escape or be released. Thus, wild aquatic animal populations may be exposed to pathogens introduced via the movement of animals for farming. In addition, high stocking density (and short lifespans) favours the selection of virulent pathogen strains. Suboptimal farm conditions (poor water quality and co-infections) can lead to decreased host resistance, leading to more severe signs of disease and higher prevalence. 4. Many emerging diseases have already seriously affected populations of wild aquatic animals. Future disease emergence presents a threat to freshwater animal populations. Early detection and prompt action, however, can minimise the impact of emerging diseases. Aquaculture and the ornamental trade pose significant threats to wild populations by acting as ultimate drivers for disease emergence via pathways summarised in our causal web. An improved understanding of the influence of human activities will allow us to evaluate the risks associated with current practices, identify measures to mitigate the likelihood and impact of disease emergence."

In 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the discovery of a previously unidentified pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Since its initial description, hMPV has been associated with ARTI in Europe (Italy, France, Spain, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Norway), America (the USA, Canada, Argentina and Brazil), Asia (India, Japan, China and Singapore), Australia and South Africa in individuals of all ages. The incidence of infection varies from 1.5% to 25%, indicating that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with a worldwide distribution. hMPV seems to play an important role as a cause of paediatric upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with similar, but not identical, epidemiological and clinical features to those of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Moreover, the socio-economic impact of hMPV-infected children on their families seems to be considerable, which suggests that, like influenza virus, hMPV infection may be a substantial public health problem for the community. It may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in pre-term infants and children with underlying clinical conditions, although more adequately controlled studies are needed to confirm its importance in such patients. Many fundamental questions concerning the pathogenesis of hMPV disease and the host's specific immune response remain to be answered.

In Norway, hooded and harp seals and minke whales are commercially harvested, and coastal seals (harbour and grey seals) are hunted as game. Marine mammal meat is sold to the public and thus included in general microbiological meat control regulations. Slaughtering and dressing of marine mammals are performed in the open air on deck, and many factors on board sealing or whaling vessels may affect meat quality, such as the ice used for cooling whale meat and the seawater used for cleaning, storage of whale meat in the open air until ambient temperature is reached, and the hygienic conditions of equipment, decks, and other surfaces. Based on existing reports, it appears that meat of seal and whale does not usually represent a microbiological hazard to consumers in Norway, because human disease has not been associated with consumption of such foods. However, as hygienic control on marine mammal meat is ad hoc, mainly based on spot-testing, and addresses very few human pathogens, this conclusion may be premature. Additionally, few data from surveys or systematic quality control screenings have been published. This review examines the occurrence of potential human pathogens in marine mammals, as well as critical points for contamination of meat during the slaughter, dressing, cooling, storage and processing of meat. Some zoonotic agents are of particular relevance as foodborne pathogens, such as Trichinella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Salmonella and Leptospira spp. In addition, Mycoplasma spp. parapoxvirus and Mycobacterium spp. constitute occupational risks during handling of marine mammals and marine mammal products. Adequate training in hygienic procedures is necessary to minimize the risk of contamination on board, and acquiring further data is essential for obtaining a realistic assessment of the microbiological risk to humans from consuming marine mammal meat."

While peripheral markers of sympathetic activity can be obtained indirectly - by measuring heart rate, blood pressure, sweat release and skin blood flow - these effector-organ responses are slower compared to the directly recorded sympathetic nerve activity. Microneurography, in which a tungsten microelectrode is inserted percutaneously into a peripheral nerve in awake human subjects, allows one to record sympathetic nerve activity to either muscle or skin. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is involved in the beat-to-beat control of blood pressure, and is elevated during mental stress; chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure. The primary role of skin sympathetic nerve activity (SSNA) is to regulate body temperature by controlling sweat release and skin blood flow, but it has also been commandeered for emotional expression. In this review we discuss our recent work in which we have performed concurrent microelectrode recordings of MSNA or SSNA and fMRI of the brain, with a view to identifying areas in the brain responsible for generating the increases in sympathetic outflow at rest and during emotional engagement. Spontaneous bursts of MSNA at rest were positively correlated to activity in the left dorsomedial hypothalamus and left insula, and bilaterally in the ventromedial hypothalamus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Spontaneous bursts of SSNA at rest were positively correlated with activity in the left ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus, the left posterior and right anterior insula, the right orbitofrontal and frontal cortices and bilaterally in the mid-cingulate cortex and precuneus. Increases in SSNA occurred when subjects viewed emotionally charged images, resulting in increases in activity in the central and lateral amygdala, dorsolateral pons, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellar cortex; surprisingly, there was no activation of the insula in response to these emotional stimuli. We have shown that concurrent microelectrode recordings of sympathetic outflow to either muscle or skin and fMRI of the brain can be used to identify areas of the brain involved in the generation of sympathetic nerve activity. We propose that this approach can be extended to examine specific disorders of emotional expression to increase our understanding of the underlying neural processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thanks to new technologies of humanized monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapy offers real promizing perspectives for prophylactic and therapeutic therapies against a variety of current or emerging infectious diseases."

La Crosse virus (LACV) is historically transmitted by the native mosquito Aedes triseriatus (Say) in the upper Midwestern US, but the invasive congeners Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and A. japonicus (Theobald), which co-occur with A. triseriatus in water-holding containers, may be important accessory vectors in the Appalachian region where La Crosse encephalitis is an emerging disease. This review focuses on evidence for how climate, land use, and biological invasions may have direct abiotic and indirect community-level impacts on immature developmental stages (eggs and larvae) of Aedes mosquitoes. Because vector-borne diseases usually vary in space and time and are related to the ecology of the vector species, we propose that the ecology of its mosquito vectors, particularly at their immature stages, has played an important role in the emergence of La Crosse encephalitis in the Appalachian region and represents a model for investigating the effects of environmental changes on other vector-borne diseases. We summarize the health effects of LACV and associated socioeconomic costs that make it the most important native mosquito-borne disease in the US. We review of the transmission of LACV, and present evidence for the impacts of climate, land use, and biological invasions on Aedes mosquito communities. Finally, we discuss important questions about the ecology of LACV mosquito vectors that may improve our understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on LACV and other arboviruses."

This review summarises our current knowledge of the Mesomycetozoea, a poorly-studied group of fungal-like parasites that includes emerging virulent parasites capable of causing high mortality rates in fish and amphibian populations. This review considers the potential impact of emerging parasites in this class on global aquatic biodiversity. Several aspects of the biology of mesomycetozoean parasites are associated with the potential to drive hosts to extinction, including their high virulence under certain conditions, low host specificity, and a free-living infectious stage. In addition, mesomycetozoeans are currently being introduced into novel environments and hosts via the global freshwater wildlife trade. These parasites have been linked to dramatic population declines in at least one native fish throughout Europe, and there are indications that they are already impacting amphibian populations in America and Europe. The impact of mesomycetozoeans on freshwater biodiversity is likely to increase in response to stressors such as global climate change and habitat modification. Surveillance for mesomycetozoean parasites in the field and in specimens transported in the aquatic wildlife trade needs to be increased, and a tighter control of the aquatic wildlife trade is urgently needed.

The resurgence of plague after a gap of 28 years in the Gujarat and Maharashtra, is alarming and indicate a breakdown of the public health measures. Similarly, the resurgence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle in USA is raising concerns that transmission from cattle to humans might be a serious public health issue. Rapid ecological changes have given opportunities for certain zoonotic infections to emerge and produce human sufferings. Complete eradication of some of the zoonotic diseases seems to be difficult because of complex epidemiology. Nevertheless, early diagnosis and chemotherapy, personal hygiene, environmental sanitation, better animal husbandry, improved food hygiene, immunization, health education and close coordination between medical and veterinary departments may help in reducing the prevalence and incidence of zoonoses.

The aim of this study was to carry out an assessment of the diversity of bacteria, including pathogens, in ornamental fish species imported into North America and to assess their antibiotic resistance. Kidney samples were collected from 32 freshwater ornamental fish of various species, which arrived to an importing facility in Portland, Oregon from Colombia, Singapore and Florida. Sixty-four unique bacterial colonies were isolated and identified by PCR using bacterial 16S primers and DNA sequencing. Multiple isolates were identified as bacteria with potential to cause disease in both fish and humans. The antibiotic resistance profile of each isolate was performed for nine different antibiotics. Among them, cefotaxime (16% resistance among isolates) was the antibiotic associated with more activity, while the least active was tetracycline (77% resistant).

We reviewed the NZ RF surveillance sector, aiming to identify potential improvements which would support optimal RF control and prevention activities. Methods: This review used a recently developed surveillance sector review method. Interviews with 36 key informants were used to describe the sector, assess it and identify its gaps. Priorities for improvement and implementation strategies were determined following discussion with these key informants, with policy advisors and within the research team. Results: Key improvements identified included the need for a comprehensive RF surveillance strategy, integrated reporting and an online national RF register. At a managerial level this review provided evidence for system change and built support for this across the surveillance sector. Conclusions: The surveillance sector review approach can be added to the small set of tools currently available for developing and evaluating surveillance systems.

One key challenge lies in development of an effective T cell-induced response to subunit vaccines at specific sites and in different populations. ObjectivesIn this review, we consider how a proteomic systems-based approach can be used to identify putative novel vaccine targets, may be adopted to characterise subunit vaccines and adjuvants fully. Key findingsDespite the extensive potential for proteomics to aid our understanding of subunit vaccine nature, little work has been reported on identifying MHC 1-binding peptides for subunit vaccines generating T cell responses in the literature to date.

PR technologies for the treatment of single plasma units and platelet concentrates are commercially available and have been successfully implemented in more than 2 dozen countries worldwide. Ideally, all labile blood components should be PR treated to ensure a safe and sustainable blood supply in accordance with regional transfusion best practices. Recently, a device (Mirasol (R) Pathogen Reduction Technology System) for PR treatment of whole blood using riboflavin and UV light has received CE marking, a significant step forward in realising blood safety where WB transfusion is the norm, such as in sub-Saharan Africa and in far-forward combat situations.

Understanding functions of genes and proteins of this parasite is important for uncovering this pathogen's complex biology, which will provide valuable information to design new strategies for schistosomiasis control. Effective applications of molecular tools reported to investigate schistosome gene function, such as inhibitor studies and transgenesis, rely on the developments of in vitro cultivation system of this parasite and cells. Besides the in vitro culture studies dealing with Schistosoma mansoni, there are also numerous excellent studies about the in vitro cultivation of Schistosoma japonicum, which were performed by Chinese researchers and published in Chinese journals. Nearly every stage of the life-cycle of S. japonicum. including miracidia, mother sporocysts, cercariae, schistosomula, and egg-laying adult worms, was employed for developing in vitro cultivation methods, being accompanied by the introduction of several media and supplements that helped to improve culture conditions. It was not only possible to generate mother sporocysts from miracidia in vitro, but also to obtain adult worms from cercariae through in vitro cultivation. The main obstacles to complete the life cycle of S. japonicum in the lab are the transition from mother sporocysts to cercariae, and the production of fertilized and completely developed eggs by adult worms generated in vitro. With regard to cells from S.japonicum, besides established isolation protocols and morphological observations, media optimizations were conducted by using different chemical reagents, biological supplements and physical treatment. Among these, mutagens like N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and the addition of extracellular matrix were found to be able to induce mitogenic activities. Although enzyme activities or the level of silver-stained nucleolar region associated protein in cultured cells indicated still suboptimal conditions, the achievements made point to the possibility of reaching the aim of establishing cell lines for S. japonicum. Both the improvements of the in vitro culture of larval and adult worms of S.japonicum as well as the access of cells of this parasite provide excellent advances for research on this important parasite in the future.

The response is frequently characterized by a series of emergency activities to contain and manage the infection in human populations, and at the same time to identify the source of the infection in nature. If infection is found to have a source in animals, and if animals cause a continuous threat of human infection, culling is often recommended with severe economic impact. Currently, efforts are being undertaken for closer interaction at the animal/human interface through joint surveillance and risk assessment between the animal and human medicine sectors, and research is underway in geographic areas where emergence at the animal/human interface has occurred in the past. The goal of this research is to identify infectious organisms in tropical and other wild animals, to genetically sequence these organisms, and to attempt to predict which organisms have the potential to emerge in human populations. It may be more cost-effective to learn from past emergence events, and to shift the paradigm from disease surveillance, detection, and response in humans; to prevention of emergence at the source by understanding and mitigating the factors, or determinants, that influence animal infection. These determinants are clearly understood from the study of previous emergence events and include human-induced changes in natural environments, urban areas, and agricultural systems; raising and processing animal-based foods; and the roles of global trade, migration, and climate change. Better understanding of these factors learned from epidemiological investigation of past and present emergence events, and modeling and study of the cost-effectiveness of interventions that could result in their mitigation, could provide evidence necessary to better address the political and economic barriers to prevention of infections in animals. Such economically convincing arguments for change and mitigation are required because of the basic difference in animal health-driven by the need for profit; and human health-driven by the need to save lives."

We conclude, first, that there is a need for a better understanding of population dynamics and for good baseline data on wildlife population trends. Also, there is a need to adapt our wildlife management and disease control strategies to a context of growing conflicts and increasing social complexity. Second, a few pathogens appear consistently in the rankings of relevant shared diseases and tend to receive most attention from the scientific community. However, most current research on wildlife diseases is still descriptive. Therefore, a deeper understanding of disease ecology and progress in risk factor identification is needed. Third, interventions regarding wildlife diseases are rarely widespread and not necessarily successful, and three aspects need urgent regulation in order to improve wildlife health: wildlife feeding, disease control in farmed or translocated wildlife, and hunting offal disposal. While the drivers of disease emergence are still active, awareness is also growing in governmental and supra-governmental agencies, farmers, and the academy, contributing to create a fertile ground for future innovative disease control efforts."

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the commonest human prion disease and occurs in three principal forms: sporadic (idiopathic), acquired (infectious), and inherited (genetic). This chapter concerns the sporadic and acquired forms. Sporadic CJD occurs worldwide and affects mainly the middle aged and elderly. There are recognized genetic risk factors-most importantly the PRNP-129 polymorphism. The acquired forms of CJD consist of iatrogenic CJD (accidental transmission of CJD via medical or surgical procedures) and variant CJD (vJCD) (which originated as a zoonosis via bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)contamination of human food). The main causes of iatrogenic CJD are cadaveric derived human growth hormone treatment and dura mater surgical grafts. The PRNP-129 polymorphism has important effects on iatrogenic infection, including overall susceptibility and incubation period. vCJD, resulting from dietary exposure to BSE, has affected mostly the United Kingdom, followed by France. All tested cases were originally PRNP-129 MM, although two MV cases have been identified recently (one possible; one definite). vCJD has been secondarily transmitted via blood transfusion and a blood product. There is continuing concern over secondary transmission since there is evidence-from lymphoreticular tissue studies-of extensive subclinical infection in the UK general population, although a further recent study has caused uncertainty over the significance of the previous studies. While definitive diagnosis of CJD is pathological, recent developments in protein amplification and detection have led to significantly better clinical diagnosis."

Influenza viruses have three key structural proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and Matrix 2 (M2). Both HA and NA are surface glycoproteins diverse enough that their serological recognition gives rise to the traditional classification into different subtypes. At present, 16 subtypes of HA (H1-H16) and 9 subtypes of NA (N1-N9) have been identified. Among all the influenza A viruses with zoonotic capacity that have been described, subtypes H5N1 and H1N1, have shown to be the most pathogenic for humans. Direct transmission of influenza A viruses from birds to humans used to be considered a very unlikely event but its possibility to spread from human to human was considered even more exceptional. However, this paradigm changed in 1997 after the outbreaks of zoonotic influenza affecting people from Asia and Europe with strains previously seen only in birds. Considering the susceptibility of pigs to human and avian influenza viruses, and the virus ability to evolve and generate new subtypes, that could more easily spread from pigs to humans, the possibility of human epidemics is a constant menace. A recent example was the outbreak of H1N1 influenza in 2009 that crossed species and geographical borders affecting up to 20 to 40% of the people in some parts of the world. Vaccines and control measures are continuously being developed to address a threat that every year claims human and animal lives, and makes us fear for a new and more lethal strain of the virus."

We provide a brief history of the system, then focus on key insights into Bd variation garnered from genomics approaches, and finally, highlight new frontiers for future discoveries. Genomic tools have revealed unexpected complexity and variation in the Bd system suggesting that the history and biology of emerging pathogens may not be as simple as they initially seem."

In this review, we focus on black band disease (BBD), one of the most virulent diseases and the only polymicrobial disease so far known to affect corals. A multipartite microbial consortium dominated by Cyanobacteria, but also including sulfur-cycling bacteria, other bacterial groups and members of the Archaea and Eukarya, forms a sulfide-rich anaerobic mat that migrates across the surface of coral colonies, killing the underlying tissues. The polymicrobial nature of the disease challenges classic aetiological approaches to unravelling disease causation. Here, we synthesize current knowledge on the range of pathogens forming the microbial consortium with recent studies on the transmission, biogeochemistry and environmental drivers of BBD to develop a conceptual model of BBD pathogenesis. The model illustrates how the development of BBD virulence factors is linked to a cascade of microbial community shifts and associated functional roles that progressively develop the microbial consortium from comparatively benign cyanobacterial patches to virulent BBD lesions. This review showcases how an approach that integrates multiple key aspects of the disease provides insights essential to elucidating the aetiology of BBD."

As part of the U. S.

Many of these activities are in direct support of International Health Regulations (IHR[2005]). The network also supports host country military forces around the world, which are equally affected by these threats and are often in a unique position to respond in areas of conflict or during complex emergencies.

Internet-based surveillance systems have good congruence with traditional surveillance approaches. Additionally, internet-based approaches are logistically and economically appealing. However, they do not have the capacity to replace traditional surveillance systems; they should not be viewed as an alternative, but rather an extension. Future research should focus on using data generated through internet-based surveillance and response systems to bolster the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for emerging infectious diseases."

Mammals have developed several layers of defense against viruses, including an intracellular antiretroviral defense, a part of innate immunity. Retroviral restrictions had been studied for decades using murine leukemia virus in mice, however it has become clear that primates too have intrinsic mechanisms to ward off infections by retroviruses. Several of these antiretroviral restriction mechanisms have recently been identified, with two particularly well described factors being members of the tripartite motif (Trim) and APOBEC families. Both systems provide a strong barrier against lentiviral infections. The viruses have developed Countermeasures that allow them to replicate despite the host factors.

Across small-island developing states (SIDSs), although only a small number of IASs are widely distributed, many more, including those with greatest impact, are found on only a small number of islands. Patterns of island invasion are not consistent across SIDS geographic regions, with differences attributable to correlated patterns in island biogeography and human development. We identify 15 of the most globally prevalent IASs on islands. IAS impacts on islands are exacerbated through interactions with a number of other global change threats, including over-exploitation, agricultural intensification, urban development and climate change. Biosecurity is critical in preventing IAS invasion of islands. Eradication of IASs on islands is possible at early stages of invasion, but otherwise is largely restricted to invasive mammals, or otherwise control is the only option. Future directions in IAS management and research on islands must consider IASs within a broader portfolio of threats to species, ecosystems and people's livelihoods on islands. We advocate for stronger collaborations among island countries and territories faced with the same IASs in similar socio-ecological environments."

In 1996, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) was proposed as a novel taxon among human-derived streptococcal isolates. SDSE has Lancefield group C or G antigens, exhibits strong beta-hemolysis, and exerts streptokinase activity upon human plasminogen and proteolytic activity upon human fibrin. Similarly to group A streptococci, SDSE possesses virulence factors including M protein, streptolysin O, streptolysin S, streptokinase, hyaluronidase, C5a peptidase, and others. SDSE may exist among the normal flora of the skin, oropharynx, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. In the twenty-first century, invasive SDSE infection (i.e., cellulitis, urosepsis, and pneumonia) leading to various disseminated diseases is being diagnosed increasingly in Japan, elsewhere in Asia, in Europe, and in America. Particularly, among elderly patients, these invasive diseases are encountered increasingly in Japanese hospital emergency departments. Analysis of the part of the emm gene encoding the amino acid sequence at the N-terminal end of the M protein is used to determine the molecular epidemiology of SDSE.

The etiologic agent of WNS is the fungus Geomyces destructans, which infects the skin and wing membranes. Over 1 million bats in six species in eastern North America have died from WNS since 2006, and as a result several species of bats may become endangered or extinct. Information is lacking on the pathogenesis of G. destructans and WNS, WNS transmission and maintenance, individual and site factors that contribute to the probability of an outbreak of WNS, and spatial dynamics of WNS spread in North America. We considered how descriptive and analytical epidemiology could be used to fill these information gaps, including a four-step (modified) outbreak investigation, application of a set of criteria (Hill's) for assessing causation, compartment models of disease dynamics, and spatial modeling. We cataloged and critiqued adaptive-management options that have been either previously proposed for WNS or were helpful in addressing other emerging diseases of wild animals. These include an ongoing program of prospective surveillance of bats and hibernacula for WNS, treatment of individual bats, increasing population resistance to WNS (through vaccines, immunomodulators, or other methods), improving probability of survival from starvation and dehydration associated with WNS, modifying hibernacula environments to eliminate G. destructans, culling individuals or populations, controlling anthropogenic spread of WNS, conserving genetic diversity of bats, and educating the public about bats and bat conservation issues associated with WNS."

Spillover of nitric oxide between neurons may have a major impact on central nervous system diseases and particularly on neurodegeneration. There is evidence whereby communication between nitrergic and dopaminergic systems plays an essential role in the control of the nigrostriatal pathway. However, there is sparse information for either the coexistence or overlap of nitric oxide and dopaminergic structures. The dual localization of immunoreactivity for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and tyrosine hydroxylase, enzymes responsible for the synthesis of nitric oxide and dopamine, respectively, was examined in neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway in the rat brain by means of a double-immunohistochemical method and confocal laser scanning microscopy, acquired at the resolution limit. After perfusional fixation, the brains were cut and double-immunostained. A proximity analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase and NOS structures was done using binary masks generated from the respective maximum projections, using confocal laser microscopy. Unrevealed regions were determined somatodendritic positive for both NOS and tyrosine hydroxylase, within an image limit resolution at 2 mu m-wide margin.

The most documented examples are zoonoses, i.e. animal diseases transmitted to humans, primarily through food. The carrier animal is infected by bacteria without manifesting symptoms of this infection; these bacteria are then transmitted to another susceptible human or animal host. In some cases, carrier state prevalence in animals is very high and its degree of importance is related to the frequency and/or the seriousness of the diseases it induces. The phenomenon is misunderstood and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved could improve its control, thus reducing disease risk in humans. The use of analytical tools in relevant experimental models has enabled the initial analysis of bacterial and host factors involved in the carrier state. The most documented example is the intestinal carrier state, which was compared in several models: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium or Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in chickens, Campylobacter jejuni in the same host species and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ruminants.

Although CNS insulin action (CNSIA) modulates hepatic glycogen synthesis in dogs, it has no net effect on hepatic glucose output over a 4-hour period. The role of CNSIA in regulating plasma glucose has recently been examined in humans and is the focus of this review. Methods and Results: Intransal insulin (INI) administration increases CNS insulin concentration. Hence, INI can address whether CNSIA regulates plasma glucose concentration in humans. We and three other groups have sought to answer this question, with differing conclusions. Here we will review the critical aspects of each study, including its design, which may explain these discordant conclusions. Conclusions: The early glucose-lowering effect of INI is likely due to spillover of insulin into the systemic circulation. In the presence of simultaneous portal and CNS hyperinsulinemia, portal insulin action is dominant. INI administration does lower plasma glucose independent of peripheral insulin concentration (between similar to 3 and 6 h after administration), suggesting that CNSIA may play a role in glucose homeostasis in the late postprandial period when its action is likely greatest and portal insulin concentration is at baseline. The potential physiological role and purpose of this pathway are discussed in this review. Because the effects of INI are attenuated in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, this is unlikely to be of therapeutic utility."

There is a strong evidence for the unitary origin of the CCR5-Delta 32 mutation, this it is found principally in Europe and Western Asia, with generally a north-south downhill cline frequency. Homozygous carriers of this mutation show a resistance to HIV-1 infection and a slower progression towards AIDS. However, HIV has clearly emerged too recently to have been the selective force on CCR5. Our analyses showed strong negative correlations in Europe between the allele frequency and two historical parameters, i.e. the first colonization dates by the great ancient Mediterranean civilizations, and the distances from the Northern frontiers of the Roman Empire in its greatest expansion. Moreover, other studies have shown that the deletion frequencies in both German Bronze Age and Swedish Neolithic populations were similar to those found in the corresponding modern populations, and this deletion has been found in ancient DNA of around 7000 years ago, suggesting that in the past, the deletion frequency could have been relatively high in European populations. In addition, in West Nile virus pathogenesis, CCR5 plays an antimicrobial role showing that host genetic factors are highly pathogen-specific. Our results added to all these previous data suggest that the actual European allele frequency distribution might not be due to genes spreading, but to a negative selection resulting in the spread of pathogens principally during Roman expansion. Indeed, as gene flows from colonizers to European native populations were extremely low, the mutational changes might be associated with vulnerability to imported infections. To date, the nature of the parasites remains unknown; however, zoonoses could be incriminated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The subclinical form of this disease results in progressive weight loss, reduced milk production, lower slaughter value, and premature culling, with possible impacts on fertility and udder health. Eventually, infection can lead to the clinical form that manifests as chronic diarrhea, emaciation, debilitation, and eventual death. Currently, available tests to detect infected animals produce many false-negative results and some false-positives, particularly in subclinically infected animals, thus making their interpretation and utilization challenging in control programs.

Peat was used in the 1990s for a similar purpose; however, most farmers ceased feeding peat as a supplement because of its frequent contamination with conditionally pathogenic mycobacteria, esp. with Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis. The aim of the present paper is to review available literature from the standpoint of the advantages and disadvantages related to feeding kaolin as a supplement to animals. Its positive effects exerted through the diet primarily consist in its adsorbent capability which may be useful for detoxification of the organism and for prevention of diarrheal diseases in pigs. Because the mechanism of action of kaolin fed as a supplement is unknown, a risk related to its potential interactions with other nutrient compounds of the diet exists. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effectiveness and safety of feeding kaolin in detail with regard to the health status and performance of each farm animal species. The disadvantage of kaolin use is its potential toxicity, provided it has been mined from the environment with natural or anthropogenic occurrence of toxic compounds. Another risk factor is a potential contamination of originally sterile kaolin with conditionally pathogenic mycobacteria from surface water, dust, soil, and other constituents of the environment in the mines during kaolin extraction, processing and storage."

This is the first work to gather all available data on the historical aspects involving the cases of SABV infection along with an update on its characteristic features."
3990,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Principi, N; Esposito, S",kingella kingae infections in children,2015,BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES,Web of Science,"Background: Improvements in culture techniques and molecular detection methods have led to findings indicating that, particularly in infants and young children, Kingella kingae is a significantly more important pathogen than previously thought. However, despite this, the pediatric community is still largely unaware of the existence of this organism. The aim of this review is therefore to summarise current knowledge of the epidemiology, transmission, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of K. kingae infections in children. Discussion: K. kingae is a common coloniser of the oropharynx, can be transmitted from child to child, and can cause outbreaks of infection. Invasive infections almost exclusively occur in children aged between six months and four years of age, and involve mainly joints and bone, less frequently the endocardium, and very rarely other localisations. With the exception of bacteremia and endocarditis, which can be followed by severe complications, the diseases due to K. kingae are usually accompanied by mild to moderate clinical signs and symptoms, and only slightly altered laboratory data. Moreover, they generally respond to widely used antibiotics, although resistant strains are reported. However, the mild symptoms and limited increase in the levels of acute phase reactants create problems because K. kingae disease may be confused with other clinical conditions that have a similar clinical picture. Conclusions: Although K. kingae was identified more than 50 years ago, it is poorly known by pediatricians and is not systematically sought in laboratories. Education is therefore necessary in order to reduce the risk of outbreaks, permit the early identification of K. kingae infections, and allow the prompt prescription of adequate therapeutic regimens capable of avoiding the risk of a negative evolution in those cases in which this elusive pathogen can cause significant clinical problems."
3991,Joy,NO,NA,"Pattnaik, P",kyasanur forest diseasea: an epidemiological view in india,2006,REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY,Web of Science,"Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) was first recognised as a febrile illness in the Shimoga district of Karnataka state of India. The causative agent, KFD virus (KFDV), is a highly pathogenic member in the family Flaviviridae, producing a haemorrhagic disease in infected human beings. KFD is a zoonotic disease and has so far been localised only in a southern part of India. The exact cause of its emergence in the mid 1950s is not known. A variant of KFDV, characterised serologically and genetically as Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), has been recently identified in Saudi Arabia. KFDV and AHFV share 89% sequence homology, suggesting common ancestral origin. Homology modelling of KFDV envelope (E) protein exhibited a structure similar to those of other flaviviruses, suggesting a common mechanism of virus-cell fusion. The possible mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction involved in infection by KFDV may resemble that of other flavivirses. Present understanding is that KFDV may be persisting silently in several regions of India and that antigenic and structural differences from other tick borne viruses may be related to the unique host specificity and pathogenicity of KFDV. From January 1999 through January 2005, an increasing number of KFD cases have been detected in Karnataka state of Indian subcontinent despite routine vaccination, suggesting insufficient efficacy of the current vaccine protocol. However, the exact cause of the increase of KFD cases needs further investigation. Considering the requirement of safer and more effective vaccines in general, there is clearly a need for developing an alternative vaccine as well as a rapid diagnostic system for KFD. The changing ecology of the prime focus of the KFD also warrants attention, as it may lead to establishment of the disease in newer localities, never reported before.

Given that rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis is central to controlling abortion outbreaks, the submission of tissue samples to laboratories offering the most appropriate tests is essential. Direct antigen and/or DNA detection methods are the currently preferred methods of reaching an aetiological diagnosis, and ideally these results are confirmed by the demonstration of corresponding macroscopic and/or histopathological lesions in the fetus and/or the placenta. However, the costs of laboratory examinations may be considerable and, even under optimal conditions, the percentage of aetiological diagnoses reached can be relatively low. This review focuses on the most commonly occurring and important abortifacient pathogens of ruminant species in Europe highlighting their epizootic and zoonotic potential.

Humans can become infected by ingesting B. procyonis eggs, which can remain viable in the environment for years and adhere to vegetation, soil, water, raccoon feces, or hands. Parasitic infections manifest in humans with neural and ocular larva migrans, characterized by clinical symptoms of head and body tilt, circling, recumbency, ataxia, blindness, nervous behavior, paralysis, and coma, leading to death. Prevalence of B. procyonis in humans is unknown. However, human cases may be more common in endemic areas than initially suspected because humans with low-level infections may not develop clinical signs and can go undiagnosed. Therefore, the prevalence of human B. procyonis infections can be high, especially in endemic areas where suburban sprawl increases the likelihood of frequent human contact with raccoons and their latrines. We surveyed adults from Texas to ascertain their knowledge of raccoon behavior and of B. procyonis as a potential zoonotic disease. No differences were observed in responses due to gender, ethnicity, age, or education level. In general, Texans had superficial knowledge of raccoon behavior and virtually no knowledge of B. procyonis and its inherent dangers as a zoonotic disease. Due to the apparent limited public awareness about the potential clinical hazards presented by B. procyonis, greater public education efforts are warranted."

We reviewed studies on the diet of Bonelli's eagles (Hieraaetus fasciatus) in order to determine the repercussions of the reduction in the density of its main prey, the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), caused by outbreaks of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) since 1988. Location Western continental Europe. Methods We compiled published and unpublished information on the diet of breeding Bonelli's eagles from Portugal, Spain and France for a 39-year study period (1968-2006). Nonparametric tests were used in order to analyse temporal shifts in diet composition and trophic diversity (H') between the periods of 'high' (before outbreak of RHD) and 'low' rabbit density (after outbreak of RHD). A combination of hierarchical agglomerative clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses were used to test for the existence of geographical patterns in the diet of Bonelli's eagles in each period. Results The diet of the Bonelli's eagle consisted of rabbit (28.5%), pigeons (24.0%), partridges (15.3%), 'other birds' (11.6%), 'other mammals' (7.1%), corvids (7.0%), and herptiles (6.4%). However, RHD had large consequences for its feeding ecology: the consumption of rabbits decreased by one-third after the outbreak of RHD. Conversely, trophic diversity (H') increased after outbreak of RHD. At the same time, the analyses showed clear geographical patterns in the diet of the Bonelli's eagle before, but not after, RHD outbreak. Main conclusions Geographical patterns in the diet of the Bonelli's eagle in western Europe seem to be driven mainly by spatio-temporal variation in the abundance of rabbits and, to a lesser extent, by the local (territorial) environmental features conditioning the presence and density of alternative prey species. We show that an EID can disrupt predator-prey relationships at large spatial and temporal scales through a severe decline in the population of the main prey species. Hence we argue that strict guidelines should be drawn up to prevent human-aided dissemination of 'pathogen pollution', which can threaten wildlife not only at the population and species level but also at the community and ecosystem scale."

The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL, the epidemiological role of the cat in L. infantum infection, clinical manifestations, and recommendations on diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, prognosis and prevention of infection, in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats. The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence-based studies and case reports, clinical experience and critical consensus discussions. While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis, clinical illness due to L. infantum in cats is rare. The prevalence rates of feline infection with L. infantum in serological or molecular-based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 %. Cats are able to infect sand flies and, therefore, they may act as a secondary reservoir, with dogs being the primary natural reservoir. The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative, exfoliative, crusting or nodular dermatitis (mainly on the head or distal limbs), ocular lesions (mainly uveitis), feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome, mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions, hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia. Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis is based on serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) or culture. If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL, the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods (cytology, histology with IHC, PCR, culture) should be employed. The most common treatment used is allopurinol. Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases. Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy. Follow-up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests, serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses. Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available."

The presented article concerns the main characteristics of leptospirosis and describes formerly known and recently observed environmental, occupational and recreational risk factors significant in the spreading and pathogenesis of the disease. The aspects of epidemiology significant in the temperate climatic zone are emphasized. The majority of cited articles present cases of the disease reported from Europe or North America. Climatic changes (warming) and extreme weather events such as floods are potential risk factors of leptospirosis. Also, some socio-economic phenomena, such as the intensive migration of people resulting in the transfer of the infections acquired in tropical countries, or worsening of economic status in the cities, increase the probability of disease. Apart from the danger connected with rodents, which are the main vectors of leptospires, occurrence of the disease in dogs and cats can generate a higher risk of infection for humans. Infections may also be acquired during various types of agricultural work and during recreational activities, such as swimming. The results of recent investigations show that ticks are also potential vectors of leptospires. The more frequent emergence of leptospirosis in countries located in the temperate climatic zone emphasize the need to verify knowledge related to the risk of its appearance, and to consider this disease during diagnostic processes."

The genus includes a large number of serovars that may be sheed in the urine of infected animals creating a highly infectious source of transmission. Numerous species of wild and domestic mammals act as maintenance hosts and form reservoirs of the bacteria, with other species being incidental hosts that may develop the disease. In dogs and cats, the disease is caused by different serovars and while dogs act as maintenance host for some serovars, both species are incidental host for others. Dogs and cats may have frequent contact with wild and domestic farm animals, therefore they are an important link in the transmission route. Leptospira may survive in the environment which increases the complexity of the epidemiology. The presentation of the disease can be highly variable and, particularly for feline leptospirosis, not well described. Laboratory testing is essential for the diagnosis. however, it is complicated due to the need to discriminate between Leptospira infection in animals with clinical disease from leptospiral specific antibody responses in maintenance hosts, or in animals with subclinical infection.

Over the past 25 years, leptospirosis has been reported to occur in individual cases as well as in herd outbreaks in farmed deer and in human cases linked to farmed deer. Serological studies and evidence from bacterial culture suggest infection is widespread. Mixing of young stock from several sources appears to be a significant risk factor for outbreaks. The culture of Leptospira interrogans serovars Hardjobovis, Pomona and Copenhageni has been reported. Infection with serovar Hardjobovis had the highest prevalence, either individually or mixed with serovar Pomona. Infection with serovar Copenhageni appears uncommon and its pathogenicity in deer is unproven. Titres to serovars Australis, Ballum, Balcanica and Tarassovi have been reported. Deer appear to be maintenance hosts for serovar Hardjobovis, incidental or accidental hosts and probably a maintenance population for serovar Pomona, since some infections persist for several months, and accidental hosts for serovar Copenhageni. Serovar Pomona appears to produce clinical and probably subclinical disease, whereas serovar Hardjobovis appears to cause only subclinical disease, although the relative risk of disease causation has not been determined. Clinical disease is usually manifested by haemolysis, jaundice, renal lesions, haemoglobinuria and often by sudden death. Renal lesions are commonly observed at slaughter and many are associated with leptospiral infections. Occupationally, slaughterhouse workers appear to be at greatest risk of contracting the disease from deer. Vaccination produces serological responses, but its effectiveness in protecting against disease, and prevention or reduction of shedding in urine, has not yet been confirmed in deer. More robust knowledge of the epidemiology of leptospiral infections in deer, and the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccination regimes, is needed to assist the deer industry to develop a strategy to manage this disease."

Today, diagnostic metagenomics is becoming the standard procedure for the detection and genetic characterization of new viruses or novel virus variants. Here, we provide an overview about technical considerations of high-throughput sequencing-based diagnostic metagenomics together with selected examples of ""virus discovery"" for animal diseases or zoonoses and metagenomics for food safety or basic veterinary research."

A number of helminth parasites may be involved. The most prevalent lungworm in domestic cats is Aelurostrongylus abstrusus. Oslerus rostratus and Troglostrongylus species are found mainly in wild cats. The trichurid Capillaria aerophila has a low host specificity and is not uncommon in cats. Additionally the lung flukes Paragonimus species are reported in many species outside of Europe, including cats. Clinical signs: Lungworm infections may be asymptomatic, or cause mild to severe respiratory signs, dependent on the worm species and burden; mixed infections are observed. Kittens can be vertically infected and may develop a more severe disease. Affected cats show a productive cough, mucopurulent nasal discharge, tachypnoea, dyspnoea and, in severe cases, respiratory failure and death. Management: Early diagnosis and treatment greatly improves the prognosis. First-stage larvae can be easily detected in fresh faecal samples; the Baermann migration method is the enrichment technique of choice, but takes 24 h. Lungworm larvae can be found in tracheal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but with less sensitivity than in faeces. Molecular methods have been developed that exhibit high specificity and sensitivity, and allow diagnosis in the prepatent phase. Treatment options include fenbendazole paste, milbemycin oxime/praziquantel and various spot-on formulations. Severe cases should receive prompt medical care in an intensive care unit. Prevention: Avoiding predation is at present the only preventive measure for pulmonary worms with indirect life cycles. Zoonotic risk: C aerophila has zoonotic potential, causing severe pulmonary disease in humans. Some Paragonimus species are also of zoonotic concern."

These agents have been discovered serendipitously or through active investigation of atypical serology results, cell culture contamination, unexpected histopathology, or previously unrecognized clinical disease syndromes. The potential research impact of these agents is not fully known. Infected rodents have demonstrated immunomodulation, tumor suppression, clinical disease (particularly in immunodeficient rodents), and histopathology. Perturbations of organismal and cellular physiology also likely occur. These agents posed unique challenges to laboratory animal resource programs once discovered; it was necessary to develop specific diagnostic assays and an understanding of their epidemiology and transmission routes before attempting eradication, and then evaluate eradication methods for efficacy. Even then management approaches varied significantly, from apathy to total exclusion, and such inconsistency has hindered the sharing and transfer of rodents among institutions, particularly for genetically modified rodent models that may not be readily available. As additional infectious agents are discovered in laboratory rodents in coming years, much of what researchers have learned from experiences with the recently identified pathogens will be applicable. This article provides an overview of the discovery, detection, and research impact of infectious agents recently identified in laboratory rodents. We also discuss emerging syndromes for which there is a suspected infectious etiology, and the unique challenges of managing newly emerging infectious agents."

Products for in-feed medication with these compounds in combination with other antimicrobials are commonly used in Europe. Most recently approved injectable macrolides have very long elimination half-lives in both pigs and cattle, which allows once-only dosing regimens. Both in-feed medication and use of long-acting injections result in low concentrations of the active substance for prolonged periods, which causes concerns related to development of antimicrobial resistance. Acquired resistance to macrolides and lincosamides among food animal pathogens, including some zoonotic bacteria, has now emerged. A comparison of studies on the prevalence of resistance is difficult, since for many micro-organisms no agreed standards for susceptibility testing are available. With animal pathogens, the most dramatic increase in resistance has been seen in the genus Brachyspira. Resistance towards macrolides and lincosamides has also been detected in staphylococci isolated from pigs and streptococci from cattle.

Despite the well known short-term benefits of treating patients for schistosomiasis, the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns to control the disease in the long term remains unresolved. Recent findings Many studies have advocated the success of MDA programs in order to attract donor funds for elimination efforts but such successes are often short-lived given the drug does not alter the life cycle of the organism or prevent reinfection. Within a matter of months to years after halting treatment, the prevalence, intensity of infection and morbidity of disease return to baseline levels. Other mitigating factors contribute to the failings of MDA campaigns namely: poverty, poor drug coverage, poor drug compliance, and, in the case of Asiatic schistosomiasis, zoonotic transmission. Genetic and innate and acquired immunologic mechanisms complicate the epidemiologic picture of schistosomiasis globally, and may contribute indirectly to MDA shortcomings. The possibility of drug resistance is an ever present concern because of the sole reliance on one drug, praziquantel. Summary Preventive chemotherapy is advocated for the global control and elimination of schistosomiasis.

In humans, IAV is a respiratory pathogen that causes seasonal infections associated with significant morbidity in young and elderly populations, and has a large economic impact. Moreover, IAV has the potential to cause both zoonotic spillover infection and global pandemics, which have significantly greater morbidity and mortality across all ages. The pathology associated with these pandemic and spillover infections appear to be the result of an excessive inflammatory response leading to severe lung damage, which likely predisposes the lungs for secondary bacterial infections. The lung is protected from pathogens by alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, tissue resident alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. The importance of mast cells during bacterial and parasitic infections has been extensively studied; yet, the role of these hematopoietic cells during viral infections is only beginning to emerge. Recently, it has been shown that mast cells can be directly activated in response to IAV, releasing mediators such histamine, proteases, leukotrienes, inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral chemokines, which participate in the excessive inflammatory and pathological response observed during IAV infections. In this review, we will examine the relationship between mast cells and IAV, and discuss the role of mast cells as a potential drug target during highly pathological IAV infections. Finally, we proposed an emerging role for mast cells in other viral infections associated with significant host pathology."

While improvements in ascertainment explain some of these trends, deferred childbearing, increasing population rates of coexisting disease, multifetal pregnancy, and emerging infections also contribute. Risk is markedly elevated among certain racial and ethnic minorities, due to a confluence of factors that includes behavior, biology, environmental exposures, social circumstances, and the quality of clinical care. Approximately 30-40% of maternal deaths are potentially preventable, and recent maternal mortality reviews suggest specific strategies that may improve outcomes for women suffering from the most common causes of death: cardiovascular disease, hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, venous thromboembolism, infection, and other medical conditions.

Theoretical methods can make important contributions to our understanding of migration, by allowing us to integrate findings on this complex behaviour, identify caveats in our understanding and to guide future empirical research efforts. Various mechanistic models exist to date, but their applications seem to be scattered and far from evenly distributed across taxonomic units. Therefore, we provide an overview of the major mechanistic modelling approaches used in the study of migration behaviour and characterize their fundamental features, assumptions and limitations and discuss their typical data requirements both for model parameterization and for scrutinizing model predictions. Furthermore, we review 155 studies that have used mechanistic models to study animal migration and analyse them with regard to the approaches used and the focal species, and also explore their contribution to advancing current knowledge within six broad migration ecology research themes. This identifies important gaps in our present knowledge, which should be tackled in future research using existing and to-be developed theoretical approaches."

Vaccines have not only been instrumental in controlling and even eliminating life-threatening diseases like polio, measles, diphtheria, etc., but have also been immensely powerful in enhancing the worldwide outlook of public health over the past century. Despite these successes, there are still many complex disorders (e. g., cancer, HIV, and other emerging infectious diseases) for which effective preventative or therapeutic vaccines have been difficult to develop. This failure can be attributed primarily to our inability to precisely control and modulate the highly complex immune memory response, specifically the cellular response. Dominated by B and T cell maturation and function, the cellular response is primarily initiated by potent immunostimulators and antigens. Efficient and targeted delivery of these immunomodulatory and immunostimulatory molecules to appropriate cells is key to successful development of next generation vaccine formulations. Over the past decade, particulate carriers have emerged as an attractive means for enhancing the delivery efficacy and potency of vaccines and associated immunomodulatory molecules.

This review describes recent reports of microsporidiosis in HIV-infected individuals and the growing awareness of microsporidiosis in non-HIV-infected populations. Recent findings Microsporidia were only rarely recognized as causes of disease in humans until the AIDS pandemic. Implementation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to curtail HIV replication and restore immune status drastically reduced the occurrence of opportunistic infections, including those due to microsporidia, in HIV-infected individuals. In developing countries where cART is not always accessible, microsporidiosis continues to be problematic. Improvement of diagnostic methods over the previous 25 years led to identification of several new species of microsporidia, many of which disseminate from enteric to systemic sites of infection and contribute to some unexpected lesions. Among non-HIV-infected but immune-suppressed individuals, microsporidia have infected organ transplant recipients, children, the elderly, and patients with malignant disease and diabetes. In otherwise healthy immune-competent HIV seronegative populations, self-limiting diarrhea occurred in travelers and as a result of a foodborne outbreak associated with contaminated cucumbers. Keratitis due to microsporidiosis has become problematic and a recent longitudinal evaluation demonstrated that non-HIV-infected individuals seropositive for microsporidia who had no clinical signs continued to intermittently shed organisms in feces and urine. Summary Greater awareness and implementation of better diagnostic methods are demonstrating that microsporidia contribute to a wide range of clinical syndromes in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected people.

The samples represented virus-producing cell cultures (such as SARS-coronavirus, West Nile virus, Orthopox virus), bacteria suspensions (cultures of Escherichia coli and genetically knockout apathogenic Bacillus anthracis), suspensions of parasites (malaria Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, Microsporidia cuniculi, Caenorhabditis elegans), and whole Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with microsporidia. Fresh liver samples and infected flies were fixed in Kamovsky-fixative by microwaving (20 min), all other samples were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde or Kamovsky-fixative overnight or longer. Subsequently, all samples were divided to evaluate alternative processing protocols: one part of the sample was OsO4-postfixed, ethanol-dehydrated, Epon-infiltrated (overnight) in an automated tissue processor (LYNX, Leica), and polymerized at 60 T for 48 h; in parallel the other part was microwave-assisted processed in the bench microwave device (REM, Milestone), including post-osmication and the resin block polymerization. The microwave-assisted processing protocol required at minimum 3 h 20 min: the respective epon resin blocks were uniformly polymerized allowing an easy sectioning of semi- and ultrathin sections. Sections collected on non-coated 200 mesh grids were stable in the electron beam and showed an excellent preservation of the ultrastructure and high contrast, thus allowing an easy, unequivocal and rapid assessment of specimens. Compared with conventional routine methods, microwave technology facilitates a significant reduction in sample processing time from days to hours without any loss in ultrastructural details. Microwave-assisted processing could, therefore, be a substantial benefit for the routine electron microscopic diagnostic workload. Due to its speed and robust performance it could be applied wherever a rapid electron microscopy diagnosis is required, e.g., if bioterrorism or emerging agents are suspected. Combining microwave technology with digital image acquisition, the 1-day diagnosis based on ultrathin section electron microscopy will become possible, with crucial or interesting findings being consulted or shared worldwide with experts using modem telemicroscopy tools via Internet.

The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from an asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure; overall mortality is around 35.7%. Bats harbour several betacoronaviruses that are closely related to MERS-CoV but more research is needed to establish the relationship between bats and MERS-CoV. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is very high in dromedary camels in Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV RNA and viable virus have been isolated from dromedary camels, including some with respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, near-identical strains of MERS-CoV have been isolated from epidemiologically linked humans and camels, confirming inter-transmission, most probably from camels to humans. Though inter-human spread within health care settings is responsible for the majority of reported MERS-CoV cases, the virus is incapable at present of causing sustained human-to-human transmission. Clusters can be readily controlled with implementation of appropriate infection control procedures. Phylogenetic and sequencing data strongly suggest that MERS-CoV originated from bat ancestors after undergoing a recombination event in the spike protein, possibly in dromedary camels in Africa, before its exportation to the Arabian Peninsula along the camel trading routes.

While many pathogens are brief, unpleasant visitors to human bodies, others have the ability to become life-long human passengers. The story of a pathogen's genetic code may, therefore, provide insight into the history of its human host. The evolution and distribution of disease in Africa is of particular interest, because of the deep history of human evolution in Africa, the presence of a variety of non-human primates, and tropical reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases. Methods: This study explores which pathogens leave traces in the archaeological record, and whether there are realistic prospects that these pathogens can be recovered from sub-Saharan African archaeological contexts. Results: Three stories are then presented of germs on a journey. The first is the story of HIV's spread on the back of colonialism and the railway networks over the last 150years. The second involves the spread of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite which shares its history with the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the origins of fresh-water fishing. Finally, we discuss the tantalising hints of hominin migration and interaction found in the genome of human herpes simplex virus 2. Conclusions: Evidence from modern African pathogen genomes can provide data on human behaviour and migration in deep time and contribute to the improvement of human quality-of-life and longevity."

There have been mass mortalities due to ranaviral disease but no major declines or extinctions. Controlling the transmission and spread of disease is of utmost importance, especially where there is the potential for human involvement. We have reviewed current hygiene guidelines for working with wild frogs, identified potential flaws and recommended those most suitable and effective for the field environment. Our within-site hygiene measures aim to reduce the risk of transmission among individuals. These measures encompass the capture, handling and holding of amphibians, skin disinfection before and after invasive procedures, marking frogs, sealing open wounds and treatment of accessory equipment. Our between-site hygiene measures aim to mitigate the risk of pathogen spread among populations. We have designed a risk calculator to help simplify and standardise the decision-making process for determining the level of risk and appropriate risk mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of increasing pathogen spread above background levels. Calculation of an overall risk score for pathogen spread takes into account the prior activity of field workers, the proposed activity, remoteness of the site, presence of known pathogens and the consequences of increased pathogen spread for amphibians in a given area."

Amphibians are currently threatened by the rapid global spread of the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis. Bioaugmentation of locally occurring protective bacteria on amphibians has mitigated this disease effectively in laboratory trials and one recent field trial. Areas still naive to Bd provide an opportunity for conservationists to proactively implement probiotic strategies to prevent further amphibian declines. In areas where Bd is endemic, bioaugmentation can facilitate repatriation of susceptible amphibians currently maintained in assurance colonies. Here, we synthesise the current research in amphibian microbial ecology and bioaugmentation to identify characteristics of effective probiotics in relation to their interactions with Bd, their host, other resident microbes and the environment. To target at-risk species and amphibian communities, we develop sampling strategies and filtering protocols that result in probiotics that inhibit Bd under ecologically relevant conditions and persist on susceptible amphibians. This filtering tool can be used proactively to guide amphibian disease mitigation and can be extended to other taxa threatened by emerging infectious diseases."

Disease mitigation is one essential component of population management. Here we assess existing disease mitigation strategies, some in early experimental stages, which focus on the globally emerging chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We discuss the precedent for each strategy in systems ranging from agriculture to human medicine, and the outlook for each strategy in terms of research needs and long-term potential. Results: We find that the effects of exposure to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis occur on a spectrum from transient commensal to lethal pathogen. Management priorities are divided between (1) halting pathogen spread and developing survival assurance colonies, and (2) prophylactic or remedial disease treatment. Epidemiological models of chytridiomycosis suggest that mitigation strategies can control disease without eliminating the pathogen. Ecological ethics guide wildlife disease research, but several ethical questions remain for managing disease in the field. Conclusions: Because sustainable conservation of amphibians in nature is dependent on long-term population persistence and co-evolution with potentially lethal pathogens, we suggest that disease mitigation not focus exclusively on the elimination or containment of the pathogen, or on the captive breeding of amphibian hosts. Rather, successful disease mitigation must be context specific with epidemiologically informed strategies to manage already infected populations by decreasing pathogenicity and host susceptibility. We propose population level treatments based on three steps: first, identify mechanisms of disease suppression; second, parameterize epizootiological models of disease and population dynamics for testing under semi-natural conditions; and third, begin a process of adaptive management in field trials with natural populations."

Some appear to be host-specific, but most appear able to infect multiple bee species, and some are found in insects outside of the Hymenoptera. The host range, natural geographic range and virulence in different hosts are poorly understood for most bee parasites. It is of considerable concern that the anthropogenic movement of bees species for crop pollination purposes has led to the accidental introduction of bee parasites to countries and continents where they do not naturally occur, exposing native bees to parasites against which they may have little resistance. In at least one instance, that of the South American bumble bee Bombus dahlbomii, this has led to a catastrophic population collapse. The main bees that are moved by man are the western honeybee, Apis mellifera, and two species of bumble bee, the European Bombus terrestris and the North American Bombus impatiens. We propose a range of mitigation strategies that could greatly reduce the risk of further impacts of the commercial bee trade on global,bee health, including stricter controls on international movement of bees and improved hygiene and parasite screening of colonies before and after shipping.

Modelling affords an inexpensive, a priori way of studying key parameters of wildlife rabies transmission, rabies management economics, and TM conservation. Numerous models of rabies transmission have been published. Linear density dependent models predicted that a threshold density (K-T <= 1.0), possibly attained by culling or contraception, would eliminate an epizootic through reduced contacts among host animals. Density independent models predicted less advantage of culling and contraception in rabies control due to limited contacts among territorial host animals. Recent stochastic, mixed models offer novel predictions about the role of culling, fertility control, and oral rabies vaccination (ORV) in disease management. Use of a ""threshold successful contact"" rate (C-T) as a parameter in these models predicts that density reduction of host animals will enhance ORV campaigns in non-TM contexts via more efficient bait delivery and vaccination. Economic analyses of medical, public health, and veterinary costs have shown post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and increased pet vaccinations (PV) to be major rabies-caused expenses during and after epizootics in North America. No modelling efforts have examined either the benefits-costs of rabies management strategies to conserve TM or the use of ORV, per se, to conserve TM - an omission due in part to the lack of methodologies for properly valuing TM (potential savings) and the expense or lower priority of using ORV for TM protection. This paper: (1) describes key aspects of rabies-transmission models in wildlife, (2) posits the use of CT to predict disease persistence, (3) reviews selected ORV strategies, economic studies, and benefit-cost models associated with the use of ORV as a means of rabies control in non-TM situations, (4) discusses implications of these models to the conservation of TM, and (5) recommends five steps to improve modelling of rabies transmission (wildlife disease in general), rabies-control economics, and TM conservation.

Palaeomicrobiologic data, including gene and spacer sequences, whole genome sequences and protein data, confirmed that two historical pandemics swept over Europe from probable Asian sources and possible two-way-ticket journeys back from Europe to Asia. These investigations made it possible to address questions regarding the potential sources and routes of transmission by completing the standard rodent and rodenteflea transmission scheme. This suggested that plague was transmissible by human ectoparasites such as lice, and that Y. pestis was able to persist for months in the soil, which is a source of reinfection for burrowing mammals. The analyses of seven complete genome sequences from the Bronze Age indicated that Y. pestis was probably not an ectoparasite-borne pathogen in these populations. Further analyses of 14 genomes indicated that the Justinian pandemic strains may have formed a clade distinct from the one responsible for the second pandemic, spanning in Y. pestis branch 1, which also comprises the third pandemic strains. Further palaeomicrobiologic studies must tightly connect with historical and anthropologic studies to resolve questions regarding the actual sources of plague in ancient populations, alternative routes of transmission and resistance traits. Answering these questions will broaden our understanding of plague epidemiology so we may better face the actuality of this deadly infection in countries where it remains epidemic. M.

It is a real emergency since monkey pox had been confined to Africa for several decades, where small epidemics occurred from time to time. monkey pox is a ""miniature smallpox"" which, in Africa, evolves on an endemic (zoonotic) mode with, as reservoirs, several species of wild rodents (mainly squirrels) and some monkey species. It can be accidentally transmitted to man then develops as epidemics, sometimes leading to death. The virus was imported in 2003 in the United States of America, via Gambia rats and wild squirrels (all African species), and infected prairie dogs (which are now in fashion as pets), then crossed the species barrier to man. In the United States of America, screening campaigns, epidemiological investigations, and subsequent treatments led to a rapid control of the epidemic, which is a model of emergent disease for this country.

Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever. Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield. 2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood, multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike. 3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry. 4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao in new, thinned forest sites can be named 'short-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In a 'long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted. Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks, whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term monetary benefits. 5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective, natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and ecological needs and provides a 'diversified food-and-cash crop' livelihood strategy."

Deer-to-deer transmission occurs, but the majority of herd breakdowns are believed to be from infected vectors. Factors likely to affect the susceptibility of deer include age, environment, population density, exposure and genetics. Avian tuberculosis occasionally causes clinical disease in wild, captive and farmed deer in New Zealand and overseas. Mycobacterium intracellulare, and subspecies of M. avium other than M. paratuberculosis, are widespread throughout New Zealand and are thought to be largely responsible for the high level of sensitisation to avian purified protein derivative (PPD), which is used for comparison purposes in tuberculosis skin testing of deer in this country. Infections with these organisms are usually subclinical in farmed deer, although M. avium subsp avium commonly causes lesions in retropharyngeal, mesenteric and ileocaecal lymph nodes. These lesions cause problems because of their gross and microscopic similarity to those due to M. bovis infection. Birds and domestic animals are most likely to become infected via environmental contamination of food, water, bedding litter or soil, while carnivores or scavengers may also become infected by ingesting infected carcasses. Johne's disease has been reported in deer in the wild and in zoos, especially in North America, the United Kingdom (UK) and Europe. Since first being confirmed in farmed deer in New Zealand in 1979, the incidence of Johne's disease has increased steadily. To date, M. paratuberculosis has been identified in >600 farmed deer on 300 properties. The majority of cases have been identified from suspected tuberculous lesions submitted from deer slaughter plants. Clinically, Johne's disease in deer is similar to the disease in sheep and cattle, with typical signs of loss of weight and condition, and diarrhoea. However, outbreaks of Johne's disease frequently occur in young red deer, 8-15 months of age, whereas the clinical disease in sheep and cattle is sporadic and usually affects adults 3-5 years of age. The disease is characterised by a chronic granulomatous enteritis and lymphadenitis, especially affecting the jejunum and ileum and the mesenteric lymph nodes. Deer affected subclinically may have lesions in these lymph nodes at slaughter, which are grossly indistinguishable from those due to bovine tuberculosis. Because of the antigenic similarity between M. intracellulare and all the subspecies of M. avium, including M. paratuberculosis, the diagnostic tests for Johne's disease lack sensitivity and specificity, making control difficult."

The controversy is due to the fact that Crohn's disease is so similar to a disease of MAP-infected ruminant animals, Johne's disease; and, though MAP can be readily detected in the infected ruminants, it is much more difficult to detect in humans. Molecular techniques that can detect MAP in pathologic Crohn's specimens as well as dedicated specialty labs successful in culturing MAP from Crohn's patients have provided strong argument for MAP's role in Crohn's disease. Perhaps more incriminating for MAP as a zoonotic agent is the increasing number of diseases with which MAP has been related: Blau syndrome, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and multiple sclerosis. In this article, we debate about genetic susceptibility to mycobacterial infection and human exposure to MAP; moreover, it suggests that molecular mimicry between protein epitopes of MAP and human proteins is a likely bridge between infection and these autoimmune disorders."

Even though the exact cause of T1DM is yet to be ascertained, varying degree of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors have been linked to the disease progress and outcome. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is an obligate zoonotic pathogen that causes chronic infection of intestines in ruminants, the Johne's disease. MAP that can even survive pasteurization and chlorination has also been implicated to cause similar type of enteritis in humans called Crohn's disease. With the increasing recognition of the link between MAP and Crohn's disease, it has been postulated that MAP is an occult antigen which besides Crohn's could as well be thought to trigger T1DM. Epitope homologies between mycobacterial proteins (Hsp 65) and pancreatic glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 65) and infant nutrition studies implicate MAP as one of the triggers for T1DM. PCR and ELISA analyses in diabetic patients from Sardinia suggest that MAP acts as a possible trigger for T1DM. Systematic mechanistic insights are needed to prove this link. Unfortunately, no easy animal model(s) or in-vitro systems are available to decipher the complex immunological network that is triggered in MAP infection leading to T1DM."

Infection and disease are mainly in domestic livestock but can affect many species including primates. Johne's is a new disease which emerged at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and principally involved Europe and North America. It has since spread to former low incidence regions to become a global problem. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammation of the intestine in humans which emerged in Europe and North America mid 20th century and increased to become a major healthcare problem. It has now spread to former low incidence regions. Infected animals shed Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in milk and into the environment. Human populations are widely exposed. Outcomes maybe influenced by microbial phenotype. Exposure to extracellular forms of these pathogens may confer some natural protection; exposure to intracellular forms which have passaged through milk macrophages or environmental protists may pose a greater threat to humans particularly individuals with an inherited or acquired susceptibility. Hot spots of human disease such as in Winnipeg which sits on rock at the junction of two rivers may result from local exposure to high levels of waterborne pathogens brought down from farmland. When appropriate methods are used most people with Crohn's disease are found to be infected. There are no data which demonstrate that these pathogens are harmless to humans. An overwhelming balance of probability and Public health risk favours the conclusion that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis is also pathogenic for people. A two tier cooperative pathogenic mechanism is proposed in Crohn's disease. Intracellular infection with the primary pathogen widely distributed throughout the gut causes an immune dysregulation and a specific chronic enteric neuropathy with loss of mucosal integrity. Segments of gross inflammatory disease result from the perturbed neuroimmune response to penetration into the gut wall of secondary pathogens from the lumen. These include both normal gut organisms and educated members of the enteric microbiome such as more aggressive E. coli. More new diseases may arise from failure to apply a range of remedial measures to this longstanding zoonotic problem.

The advent of polymerase chain reaction and other molecular methods have made studies on M. genitalium more feasible, which is otherwise a difficult organism to isolate. Besides Chlamydia trachomatis, M. genitalium is now an important and established cause of non gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men, more so in persistent and recurrent NGU. Multiple studies have also shown a positive association of M. genitalium with mucopurulent cervicitis and vaginal discharge in females as well. The evidences for M. genitalium pelvic inflammatory diseases and infertility are quite convincing and indicate that this organism has potential to cause ascending infection. Lack of clear association with M. genitalium has been reported for bacterial vaginosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Diagnosis of M. genitalium infections is performed exclusively using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), owing to poor or slow growth of bacterium in culture.

As only scattered data regarding these are available, an attempt has been made to assemble the available literature. To our knowledge, this is the first review paper regarding mycoplasmosis in wildlife. The outbreaks of mycoplasmoses such as contagious pleuropneumonia (CCPP), infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC), Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and Mycoplasma capricolum subspp. capricolum infections, and contagious agalactia in wild ruminants; mycoplasmosis in raccoons; upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and Mycoplasma crocodyli and Mycoplasma alligatoris infections in wild reptiles; and house finch conjunctivitis are showing that the prevalence of mycoplasmosis in wildlife has reached an alarming level, thus raising concerns for the conservation of many endangered species in captivity and free-ranging populations. These also emphasize the urgent need for increased surveillance and control of mycoplasma in wildlife. Some control approaches that can be followed are prevention of the spillover from domestic livestock and birds, proper quarantine of newly received animals along with mycoplasma screening, isolation of affected and suspected animals, screening of mycoplasmoses before the release of captive animals into free-ranging population, etc. At the same time, the previous dogma that mycoplasma have strict host specificity should be reconsidered in the light of new findings."

However, in European rabbits (Orycrolagus cuniculus) the same virus causes the lethal disseminated disease myxomatosis. The introduction of myxoma virus into the European rabbit population in Australia in 1950 initiated the best known example of what happens when a novel pathogen jumps into a completely naive new mammalian host species. The short generation time of the rabbit and their vast numbers in Australia meant evolution could be studied in real time. The carefully documented emergence of attenuated strains of virus that were more effectively transmitted by the mosquito vector and the subsequent selection of rabbits with genetic resistance to myxomatosis is the paradigm for pathogen virulence and host-pathogen coevolution. This natural experiment was repeated with the release of a separate strain of myxoma virus in France in 1952. The subsequent spread of the virus throughout Europe and its coevolution with the rabbit essentially paralleled what occurred in Australia. Detailed molecular studies on myxoma virus have dissected the role of virulence genes in the pathogenesis of myxomatosis and when combined with genomic data and reverse genetics should in future enable the understanding of the molecular evolution of the virus as it adapted to its new host. This review describes the natural history and evolution of myxoma virus together with the molecular biology and experimental pathogenesis studies that are informing our understanding of evolution of emerging diseases.

In the past several years, the designs of many immunoaffinity reagents have focused on lowering costs and improving specificity while also promoting stability. Antibody fragments (scFvs) have long been displayed on the surface of yeast and phage libraries for selection; however, the stable production of such fragments presents challenges that hamper their widespread use in diagnostics. Membrane and cell wall proteins similarly suffer from stability problems when solubilized from their native environment. Recently, cell envelope compositions that maintain membrane proteins in native or native-like lipid environment to improve their stability have been developed. This cell envelope composition approach has now been adapted toward stabilizing antibody fragments by retaining their native cell wall environment. A new class of immunoaffinity reagents has been developed that maintains antibody fragment attachment to yeast cell wall. Herein, we review recent strategies that incorporate cell wall fragments with functional scFvs, which are designed for easy production while maintaining specificity and stability when in use with simple detection platforms. These cell wall based antibody fragments are globular in structure, and heterogeneous in size, with fragments ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. These fragments appear to retain activity once immobilized onto biosensor surfaces for the specific and sensitive detection of pathogen antigens. They can be quickly and economically generated from a yeast display library and stored lyophilized, at room temperature, for up to a year with little effect on stability. This new format of scFvs provides stability, in a simple and low-cost manner toward the use of scFvs in biosensor applications. The production and ""panning"" of such antibody cell wall composites are also extremely facile, enabling the rapid adoption of stable and inexpensive affinity reagents for emerging infectious threats."

Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models.

Like their neglected tropical disease counterparts in developing countries, the neglected infections of poverty in the US disproportionately affect impoverished and under-represented minority populations. The major neglected infections include the helminth infections, toxocariasis, strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, and cysticercosis; the intestinal protozoan infection trichomoniasis; some zoonotic bacterial infections, including leptospirosis; the vector-borne infections Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, trench fever, and dengue fever; and the congenital infections cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. These diseases occur predominantly in people of color living in the Mississippi Delta and elsewhere in the American South, in disadvantaged urban areas, and in the US-Mexico borderlands, as well as in certain immigrant populations and disadvantaged white populations living in Appalachia. Preliminary disease burden estimates of the neglected infections of poverty indicate that tens of thousands, or in some cases, hundreds of thousands of poor Americans harbor these chronic infections, which represent some of the greatest health disparities in the United States. Specific policy recommendations include active surveillance ( including newborn screening) to ascertain accurate population-based estimates of disease burden; epidemiological studies to determine the extent of autochthonous transmission of Chagas disease and other infections; mass or targeted treatments; vector control; and research and development for new control tools including improved diagnostics and accelerated development of a vaccine to prevent congenital CMV infection and congenital toxoplasmosis."

Approximately 85% of the NTD disease burden results from helminth infections. Hookworm infection occurs in almost half of SSA's poorest people, including 40-50 million school-aged children and 7 million pregnant women in whom it is a leading cause of anemia. Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent NTD after hookworm (192 million cases), accounting for 93% of the world's number of cases and possibly associated with increased horizontal transmission of HIV/AIDS. Lymphatic filariasis (46-51 million cases) and onchocerciasis (37 million cases) are also widespread in SSA, each disease representing a significant cause of disability and reduction in the region's agricultural productivity. There is a dearth of information on Africa's non-helminth NTDs. The protozoan infections, human African trypanosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis, affect almost 100,000 people, primarily in areas of conflict in SSA where they cause high mortality, and where trachoma is the most prevalent bacterial NTD (30 million cases).

Neuroadrenergic abnormalities, comprising increased resting sympathetic nervous system activity and blunted sympathetic neural responsiveness are recognized features of metabolic syndrome obesity, which contribute importantly to both the pathophysiology and adverse clinical prognosis of this high-risk population. Weight loss is recommended as first-line treatment for obesity. This review examines the effects of nonpharmacological weight loss on sympathetic nervous system function under basal and stimulated conditions. Recent findings Human weight loss trials show that even moderate weight reduction is accompanied by significant attenuation in resting whole-body norepinephrine spillover rate and muscle sympathetic nerve activity, an improvement in cardiac autonomic modulation, and a reversal of blunted sympathetic responsiveness at both peripheral and central nervous system levels. Recent findings underscore the relevance of insulin resistance in mediating blunted sympathetic responsiveness to endogenous hyperinsulinemia induced by glucose ingestion. Impaired insulin transport across the blood brain barrier may be one mechanism mediating these effects. Weight loss reverses blunted sympathetic responsiveness to glucose, which has implications for postprandial energy expenditure and body weight homeostasis. Summary The autonomic dysfunction of obesity is reversible with weight loss, highlighting the importance of lifestyle intervention as a key therapeutic modality."

In spite of the large neurological affection capacity of Fasciola, this important pathogenic aspect of the disease has been pronouncedly overlooked in the past decades and has not even appear within the numerous reviews on the parasitic diseases of the central nervous system. The aim of this wide retrospective review is an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of neurological and ocular fascioliasis caused by these two fasciolid species. The terms of neurofascioliasis and ophthalmofascioliasis are restricted to cases in which the direct affection of the central nervous system or the eye by a migrant ectopic fasciolid fluke is demonstrated by an aetiological diagnosis of recovered flukes after surgery or spontaneous moving-out of the fluke through the orbit. Cases in which the ectopic fluke is not recovered and the symptoms cannot be explained by an indirect affection at distance may also be included in these terms. Neurofascioliasis and ophthalmofascioliasis cases are reviewed and discussed. With regard to fascioliasis infection giving an indirect rise to neurological affection, the distribution and frequency of cases are analysed according to geography, sex, and age. Minor symptoms and major manifestations are discussed. Three main types of cases are distinguished depending on the characteristics of their manifestations: genuine neurological, meningeal, and psychiatric or neuropsychic. The impressive symptoms and signs appearing in each type of these cases are included. Brain examination techniques and neuroimaging useful for the diagnosis of neurological cases are exposed. Within fascioliasis infection indirectly causing ocular manifestations, case distribution and frequency are similarly analysed. A short analysis is devoted to clarify the first reports of a human eye infection. The affection of related and close organs is discussed by differentiating between cases of the dorsal spine, pulmonary manifestations, heart and vessel affection, findings in blood vessels, skin and dermatologic reactions, cases of ectopic mature flukes, and upper body locations.

The diagnosis of neurological and ophthalmologic fascioliasis is analysed in depth, including clinical and paraclinical diagnosis, eosinophilia in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, differential diagnosis from other parasitic infections such as helminthiases and myiases, an update of human fascioliasis diagnosis, and fluke and/or fluke egg recovery by surgery. Diagnostic analyses with faecal and blood samples for fascioliasis patients are updated. Therapy for patients with major neurological manifestations includes both antiparasitic treatments and anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Prognosis in fascioliasis patients with neurological manifestations is discussed, with emphasis on sequelae and fatal cases, and the care of patients with ophthalmologic manifestations is added. Conclusions indicate that neurological cases are overlooked in human fascioliasis endemic areas and also in developing countries in general. In remote zones, rural health centres and small hospitals in or near the human endemic areas do not dispose of the appropriate equipments for neurological analyses. Moreover, physicians may not be aware about the potential relationship between liver fluke infection and neurological implications, and such cases may therefore remain misdiagnosed, even in developed countries. Priority should henceforth be given to the consideration of neurological and ocular affection in human endemic areas, and efforts should be implemented to assess their characteristics and frequency. Their impact should also be considered when estimating the global burden of fascioliasis."
4085,Joy,NO,NA,"Watson, J",new building old parasite: mesostigmatid mites-an ever-present threat to barrier rodent facilities,2008,ILAR JOURNAL,Web of Science,"Mesostigmatid mites are blood-sucking parasitic mites found in wild rodent populations. Periodically they can also become a problem for laboratory rodent colonies, particularly when building construction or renovations disturb colonies of commensal (building) rodents that had been acting as hosts. Mesostigmatid mites infest both rats and mice and, unlike the more common rodent fur mites (Myobia, Myocoptes, and Radfordia sp.), can survive for long periods in the environment and travel considerable distances in search of new hosts. They easily penetrate barrier caging systems, including individually ventilated cages, thus circumventing the usual precautions to protect rodents from infection. The two mites reported in laboratory rodent colonies, Ornithonyssus bacoti and Laelaps echidnina, also bite humans and have the potential to transmit zoonotic diseases. Once the mites gain access to a colony, eradication requires elimination of commensal rodent reservoirs in addition to insecticide treatment of both the laboratory rodents and the environment. In view of the undesirability of insecticide use in the animal facility, it is advisable to investigate the effectiveness of preventive treatments, such as environmental application of insect growth regulators or silica-based products. This article summarizes available information on mesostigmatid mites and their laboratory incursions, and provides suggestions for diagnosis, treatment, and control based on the author's experience with several outbreaks at a large academic institution."

Recent findings Recent epidemiologic data suggest that either the endemic areas are expanding or disease is being recognized in areas where it was not previously observed. In addition, recent data highlight the effects of fascioliasis on childhood anemia and nutrition. Diagnosis remains problematic, but newer diagnostic tests including antibody, antigen, and DNA detection tests may facilitate earlier diagnosis. Recent studies suggest that point-of-care testing may soon be possible. Treatment with triclabendazole is effective, but resistance is emerging in livestock and may pose a threat for patients. Summary Fascioliasis continues to emerge as an important neglected disease, with new studies highlighting the under-recognized burden of disease. Further studies are needed on burden of disease, improved diagnosis, and alternative to triclabendazole treatment."

Almost all incidents caused by such emerging pathogens could be ascribed to agents that are zoonotic or expanded their host range and crossed species barriers. Many different factors influence the status of a pathogen to remain unnoticed or evolve into a worldwide threat. The ability of an infectious agent to adapt to changing environmental conditions and variations in human behavior, population development, nutrition, education, social, and health status are relevant factors affecting the correlation between pathogen and host. Hantaviruses belong to the emerging pathogens having gained more and more attention in the last decades. These viruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantavirus. The serotypes Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock. In the recent past, many hantavirus isolates have been identified and classified in hitherto unaffected geographic regions in the New World (North, Middle, and South America) with characteristic features affecting the lungs of infected individuals and causing an acute pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus outbreaks in the United States of America at the beginning of the 10th decade of the last century fundamentally changed our knowledge about the appearance of the hantavirus specific clinical picture, mortality, origin, and transmission route in human beings. The hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners Region of the United States and had a lethality of more than 50%. Although the causative virus was first termed in connection with the geographic name of its outbreak region the analysis of the individual viruses indicate that the causing virus of HPS was a genetically distinct hantavirus and consequently termed as Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are assumed to share a long time period of co-evolution with specific rodent species as their natural reservoir. The degree of relatedness between virus serotypes normally coincides with the relatedness between their respective hosts. There are no known diseases that are associated with hantavirus infections in rodents underlining the amicable relationship between virus and host developed by mutual interaction in hundreds of thousands of years. Although rodents are the major reservoir, antibodies against hantaviruses are also present in domestic and wild animals like cats, dogs, pigs, cattle, and deer. Domestic animals and rodents live jointly in a similar habitat. Therefore the transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to domestic animals seems to be possible, if the target organs, tissues, and cell parenchyma of the co-habitat domestic animals possess adequate virus receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most likely incidental infection of species other than rodents as for example humans turns hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogenic agents focusing the attention on this virus group, their ecology and evolution in order to prevent the human population from a serious health risk. Much more studies on the influence of non-natural hosts on the ecology of hantaviruses are needed to understand the directions that the hantavirus evolution could pursue. At least, domestic animals that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans particularly in areas known as high endemic hantavirus regions have to be copiously screened. Each transfer of hantaviruses from their original natural hosts to other often incidental hosts is accompanied by a change of ecology, a change of environment, a modulation of numerous factors probably influencing the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. The new environment exerts a modified evolutionary pressure on the virus forcing it to adapt and probably to adopt a form that is much more dangerous for other host species compared to the original one."

Among them, viral and bacterial agents including West Nile virus, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, and rickettsioses have been recently associated with an array of ocular manifestations. These include anterior uveitis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis and optic nerve involvement. Proper clinical diagnosis of any of these infectious diseases is based on epidemiological data, history, systemic symptoms and signs, and the pattern of ocular involvement. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the detection of a specific antibody in serum. Ocular involvement associated with emergent infections usually has a self-limited course, but it can result in persistent visual impairment. There is currently no proven specific treatment for arboviral diseases, and therapy is mostly supportive. Vaccination for humans against these viruses is still in the research phase. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for rickettsial diseases. Prevention, including public measures to reduce the number of mosquitoes and personal protection, remains the mainstay for arthropod vector disease control.

Everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. The article focuses on pathogens monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all European Union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. Currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetti and Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC)/Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli (STEC). As particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. The article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ECDC but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: Streptococcus iniae, S. suis, S. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: Staphylococcus intermedius, S. pseudintermedius. Those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. The exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. These abilities derive from DNA rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. Substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem."

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an enveloped cytoplasmic RNA virus of avian origin that is highly attenuated in humans and other primates because of a strong host-range restriction. NDV infects the respiratory tract of non-human primates and appears to remain restricted to that site. As a vaccine vector, NDV induced substantial local and systemic responses against a protein expressed by a foreign gene insert and was protective against pathogen challenge. NDV is antigenically distinct from common human viruses, accommodates foreign sequences with a good degree of stability, can be readily produced in a cell line acceptable for human product development, and exhibits a low incidence of recombination. Because of its natural tropism for the respiratory tract, NDV may be particularly effective for the development of vectored vaccines against respiratory infections as well as infections that can be transmitted through the respiratory tract."

High biodiversity and bird migration facilitate spread of the pathogen and provide reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Current classical diagnostic methods designed to be virus-specific or aim to be limited to group of viral agents, hinder identifying of novel viruses or viral variants. Recently developed approaches of next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide culture-independent methods that are useful for understanding viral diversity and discovery of novel virus, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and disease control. This review discusses the different possible steps of a NGS study utilizing sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to identify novel avian viruses and their diversity. NGS lead to the identification of a wide range of new viruses such as picobirnavirus, picornavirus, orthoreovirus and avian gamma coronavirus associated with fulminating disease in guinea fowl and is also used in describing viral diversity among avian species.

A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that oral administration of nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for five days reduced the duration of clinical symptoms and reduced viral shedding compared to placebo in persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The same study also suggested a potential benefit for subjects with influenza-like illness who did not have influenza or other documented respiratory viral infection. From a chemical perspective, nitazoxanide is the scaffold for a new class of drugs called thiazolides. These small-molecule drugs target host-regulated processes involved in viral replication. Nitazoxanide is orally bioavailable and safe with extensive post-marketing experience involving more than 75 million adults and children. A new dosage formulation of nitazoxanide is presently undergoing global Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of influenza. Nitazoxanide inhibits a broad range of influenza A and B viruses including influenza A(pH1N1) and the avian A(H7N9) as well as viruses that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors. It is synergistic with neuraminidase inhibitors, and combination therapy with oseltamivir is being studied in humans as part of ongoing Phase 3 clinical development. Nitazoxanide also inhibits the replication of a broad range of other RNA and DNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus in cell culture assays. Clinical trials have indicated a potential role for thiazolides in treating rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis and chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C.

In recent years the use of cell culture and molecular biology has profoundly changed our knowledge of rickettsiae and has led to the description of several new species. New rickettsial diseases have been found in three main situations: firstly, in places where no new species have been identified, typical rickettsial symptoms have been observed (Japan, China); secondly, typical rickettsioses have been found to be caused by different organisms in such cases a new Rickettsia species has been misdiagnosed as a previously identified bacterium (for example, R. parkeri was confused with R. rickettsii); thirdly, atypical clinical symptoms have been found to be caused by rickettsial organisms such as R. slovaca. These findings challenge the old dogma that only one tick-borne rickettsiosis is prevalent in one geographical area.

Despite continuous efforts, rabies is still an incurable disease that causes thousands of deaths amongst humans worldwide. Due to a wide range of hosts and the different evolutionary paths of RABV in each host, several host-specific variants have arisen in an ongoing process. The result of RABV replication in nervous tissues may lead to two opposite clinical outcomes, i.e., paralytic/dumb form and encephalitic/furious one. The paralytic form creates dead-end hosts mainly amongst herbivores, while the furious form of the disease allows for augmented transmission when manifested in gregarious carnivores, as their natural aggressive behavior is accentuated by the disease itself.

For this to evolve toward a One Health model, both types of clinicians need to see how individual cases can be ""sentinel events'' indicating environmental risk for disease emergence, and develop mechanisms of rapid communication about these risks. Human and animal clinicians also need to take a more proactive and preventive approach to zoonotic diseases that includes the occupational health of animal workers in farms, laboratories, veterinary clinics, and other settings, as well as the recognition of increased risk among immunocompromised individuals in contact with animals. This requires training in One Health clinical competencies including the ability to diagnose and treat zoonotic diseases, implement preventive care interventions for individual patients, provide occupational health services for animal workers, recognize sentinel cases, report cases to public heath and clinical colleagues, and assess and help to intervene with environmental factors driving infectious disease risk in humans and animals. To provide an evidence base for such competency training, there is a need for development and testing of innovative protocols for One Health clinical collaborations."

The concept argues that the fields of human, animal and environmental health ought to be more closely integrated. Amid a flurry of conferences, projects and publications, there has been substantial debate over what exactly One Health is and should be. This review summarizes the main trends in this emerging discussion, highlighting the fault lines between different perspectives on One Health. Some have shown that One Health's call to synthesize knowledge from different disciplines can lead to better interventions. Others, however, argue that One Health's challenge to existing practice must go further, and set out a vision that foregrounds the social and economic drivers of disease. Meanwhile, recent examples of One Health in practice highlight the potential but also the challenges of institutionalizing cooperation. We also discuss the promise and pitfalls of using complexity theory to tackle multifaceted problems, and consider how the One Health concept has been brought to bear on other issues, such as emerging new technologies. Ultimately, One Health is an important and worthwhile goal, and requires a debate that clarifies both the competing uses and the political nature of the project."

Evaluation of poultry marketing and production systems and investigations at the animal-human interface, led to defining the routes of human exposure to avian influenza and factors that allowed virus to multiply and persist. Active and systematic surveillance of apparently healthy as well as diseased poultry and wild birds provided evidence of ongoing virus evolution in the wider region. Epidemiological studies, supplemented with molecular epidemiology, helped to elucidate the role of the poultry marketing system and live poultry markets in the persistence of avian influenza viruses and provided evidence for the impact of interventions designed to interrupt virus transmission. Enhanced bio-security, active surveillance together with targeted and evidence-based interventions in the poultry production, and marketing system together with poultry vaccination has prevented further human H5N1 disease and minimized outbreaks of poultry disease in Hong Kong. Similar strategies have led to the understanding of the emergence of SARS and provided options for preventing the re-emergence of this disease. Surveillance of influenza in swine has provided insights into the emergence of the 2009 pandemic, to the reverse zoonosis of the pandemic virus from humans to swine and to the emergence of novel reassortant viruses within swine. ""One Health'' strategies are not ""cost-free'' and require sensitive implementation to optimize food-safety and food security, while safeguarding the economics of animal husbandry and the environment and remaining sensitive to cultural practices."

These risks are particularly important when such disease results in immunodeficient states that provide an opportunity for the development of opportunistic infections. Because opportunistic agents may serve as significant confounders to research and hold potential for zoonotic transmission, knowledge of disease pathogenesis, surveillance, and risk reduction is particularly important to individuals who work closely with primates. Endogenous diseases of primates that result in blunted immune responses and thus allow for the development of opportunistic infection include simian type D retroviruses and measles. In addition, simian immunodeficiency virus is a frequently studied experimental cause of immunosuppression. This article focuses on clinical and pathological aspects of the most common opportunistic infections that occur in nonhuman primates maintained in research settings. The complete elimination of all infectious agents from primate colonies may be impossible and unwarranted, but microbial surveillance programs can help both to define the complement of agents present in a colony and to elucidate their potential impacts on colony health, zoonotic risk, and experimental research. We discuss risk reduction through the use of quarantine procedures, specific pathogen-free animals, and environmental controls."

In Sweden, this has resulted in more wildlife than was historically recorded. This positive development provides a number of opportunities for ecosystem services and for biodiversity. More wildlife also means more interactions with humans, as many birds and mammals may interfere with human interests in the landscape, such as natural resource use. Thus, more wildlife may shift the baseline for societal perception of wildlife. Wildlife species may host pathogens with potential for infecting humans and domestic animals. With increasing knowledge about zoonotic diseases and their dynamics, more scientific, media, and public attention is given to zoonotic processes. We are concerned with how the public image of the wild animals is affected, because many of the recent zoonotic outbreaks connect animal groups to diseases such as avian and swine influenza, lyme disease, and tick-borne encephalitis. The societal focus on zoonotic diseases may increase the fear of the wild and will separate the public further from the outdoors in general and wildlife in particular. Ultimately, we risk a juxtaposition of the overall acceptance of biological diversity and a shifting societal perception of wildlife that could be harmful for life on earth. We therefore suggest multidisciplinary research on societal awareness of zoonotic diseases and its implications for public acceptance for wildlife and biological diversity."

As a member of the poxviridae family and parapoxvirus genus, this.dermatotropic virus has developed an array of mechanisms by which to evade the host immune system in both humans and animals. The ubiquitousness of this pathogen in sheep, goats, and deer has led to the development of orf in diverse areas around the world. Human disease occurs via direct contact with infected animals or fomites. Rarely, human-to-human transmission has been reported. The disease progresses through six clinically distinct dermatologic stages and lesions usually heal in three to six weeks without scarring. Farmers, veterinarians, and hunters represent high-risk groups, as their repeated contact with livestock and wild animals predisposes them to infection. With an increasing number of cattle, livestock, and wild animals being kept as pets, human orf may become more prevalent in the future. Taken with the lack of a widely accepted and successful antiviral treatment regimen, this demonstrates the importance of conducting additional research to further elucidate the pathogenic effects of the OrfV in humans."

In some rare cases, mono- or multifocal osteomyelitis is described. In this paper, we report the case of bone lesions in a 13-year-old girl infected with cat scratch disease. We have also undertaken a literature review and analyzed 60 other such cases. The manifestation of a bone lesion associated with cat scratch disease was characterized by a mono- or multifocal infectious osteomyelitis, fever, and a general alteration of the patient's health. The most frequent location of osteomyelitis was in the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging appeared the most sensitive test to highlight the bone lesions. Serological findings help reinforce the diagnosis of cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae infection. Osteomyelitis in cat scratch disease is rare but not exceptional. Therefore, it is essential to think about this hypothesis in case of osteomyelitis associated with a general alteration of the patient's health, especially if the lesions are multifocal and if there is a known history of cat contact.

About 130 known arboviruses belonging to about 12 different virus families are of human or veterinarian medical importance. Many others are not pathogenic but can be interesting models for fundamental virological studies. Arboviruses survive in nature by biological transmission between vertebrate hosts and hematophage arthropoda. Arboviruses reproduce on these without change to their life or fecundity. They are transmitted through bite or sting of infected arthropoda to receptive vertebrates inducing an early and transitional viremia. A more or less complex cycle usually follows: virus, arthropoda vector, vector, vertebrate host. According to the vector's ecology, each arbovirus is present in a specific area and is always likely to invade a non-endemic zone. The arthropoda in question are ticks, mosquitoes, phlebotomes, or Culicoides (Ceratopogonidae). Vertebrates either spread or amplify the viremia or they are accidental hosts or epidemiological dead-ends. Three types of clinical presentations are described: febrile polyalgia (""dengue-like"" syndromes); hemorrhagic fever (frequently severe evolution); meningoencephalitis (frequently severe evolution ending by death or recovery with severe neurological sequels). Various arboviruses are responsible for the same clinical presentations; but a same virus can induce several types of syndromes-which stress the importance of laboratory diagnosis, based on the virus identification and specific serological tests. Prophylaxis relies on vaccination: yellow fever, tick borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and fighting against vectors. New vaccines are being studied but not on the market yet.

The amphibian-chytridiomycosis system is complex, and the response of any amphibian species to chytrid depends on many aspects of the ecology and evolutionary history of the amphibian, the genotype and phenotype of the fungus, and how the biological and physical environment can mediate that interaction. Impacts of chytridiomycosis on amphibians are varied; some species have been driven extinct, populations of others have declined severely, whereas still others have not obviously declined. Understanding patterns and mechanisms of amphibian responses to chytrids is critical for conservation and management. Robust estimates of population numbers are needed to identify species at risk, prioritize taxa for conservation actions, design management strategies for managing populations and species, and to develop effective measures to reduce impacts of chytrids on amphibians.

It affects a range of both wild and domestic animals, including sheep, which transport leptospires in their urine and, therefore, can infect other animals and humans who deal with them. Therefore, leptospirosis is characterized as an occupational zoonosis. In individual herds leptospirosis can cause severe economic loss due to miscarriages and outbreaks of mastitis with a significant reduction of milk production. The disease is caused by Leptospira interrogans, which was reclassified into 13 pathogenic species, and distributed into more than 260 serovars classified into 23 serogroups. The clinical signs of infection may vary depending on the serovar and host. In maintenance hosts, antibody production is generally low; there are relatively mild signs of the disease, and a prolonged carrier state with organisms in the kidneys. In incidental hosts, the disease may be more severe, with high titers of circulating antibodies and a very short or nonexistent renal carrier state. In general, young animals with renal and hepatic failure have more serious infections than adults. Several diseases may produce symptoms similar to those of leptospirosis, so that laboratory confirmation, through microscopic agglutination test, for example, is required. The effectiveness of treatment depends on early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, depending on clinical features, since leptospirosis can develop into chronic liver disease and nephropathy, progressing towards death. Improvements in habitation and sanitary conditions, rodent control, vaccination, isolation and treatment of affected animals are the main measures for the control of leptospirosis."

The basic idea is that by diluting the assemblage of transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts, the probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts is reduced and so the abundance of infected vectors is lowered. The same principle has recently been applied to other infectious disease systems-tick-borne, insect-borne, indirectly transmitted via intermediate hosts, directly transmitted. It is claimed that the presence of extra species of various sorts, acting through a variety of distinct mechanisms, causes the prevalence of infectious agents to decrease. Examination of the theoretical and empirical evidence for this hypothesis reveals that it applies only in certain circumstances even amongst tick-borne diseases, and even less often if considering the correct metric-abundance rather than prevalence of infected vectors. Whether dilution or amplification occurs depends more on specific community composition than on biodiversity per se. We warn against raising a straw man, an untenable argument easily dismantled and dismissed. The intrinsic value of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function outweighs this questionable utilitarian justification."

However, secondary bacterial or fungal infections on the lesion sites can aggravate the symptoms. Sore lesions located within the oral cavity and on the udders can impair feeding or nursing, thus leading to death. Livestock parapoxviruses can infect humans by direct or indirect transmission and affect mainly farmers, slaughters and veterinarians. Human symptoms generally consist of small cutaneous lesions located at the inoculation points but more severe forms can occur, peculiarly in immunocompromised persons.

Our review of the literature identified a poor knowledge of bird-parasite interactions in urban areas. While studies identifying parasites were more common than those comparing parasite abundance or host health, studies were limited geographically and to a few bird species. We found that urbanisation could have a positive or negative effect on the diversity and prevalence of bird parasites. Very few studies have linked parasite loads to bird health. We identify some hypotheses that need further consideration across broader regions and species to determine if parasites play a role in the establishment and success of birds in cities and how their health and body condition are affected.

With accelerating rates of nonnative parasites being introduced around the world, there is an increasing need to predict their ecological impacts and the network approach can be helpful in this regard. There is inherent complexity in parasite invasions as parasites are highly diverse in terms of taxa and life strategies. Furthermore, they may depend on their cointroduced host to successfully overcome some crucial steps in the invasion process. Free-living introduced species often experience enemy release during invasion, which reduces the number of introduced parasites. However, introduced parasites that successfully establish may alter the structure of the recipient network through various mechanisms including parasite spill-over and spill-back, and manipulative and nonmanipulative phenotypic alterations. Despite limited literature on biological invasions in infectious food webs, some outstanding methodological issues and the considerable knowledge gaps that remain, the network approach provides valuable insights on some challenging questions, such as the link between structure and invasibility by parasites. Additional empirical data and theoretical investigations are needed to go further and the predictive power of the network approach will be improved by incorporating weighted methods that are based on trophic data collected using quantitative methods, such as stable isotope analyses."

Tests to detect the presence of infection in a donor have a 'window period' during which infections cannot be detected but the donor may be infectious. Agents and their transmission routes need to be recognized before specific tests can be developed. Pathogen reduction of blood components represents a means to address these concerns and is a proactive approach for the prevention of transfusion-transmitted diseases. The expectation of a pathogen reduction system is that it achieves high enough levels of pathogen reduction to reduce or prevent the likelihood of disease transmission while preserving adequate cell and protein quality. In addition the system needs to be non-toxic, non-mutagenic and should be simple to use. The Mirasol (R) Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System for Platelets and Plasma uses riboflavin (vitamin B2) plus UV light to induce damage in nucleic acid-containing agents. The system has been shown to be effective against clinically relevant pathogens and inactivates leukocytes without significantly compromising the efficacy of the product or resulting in product loss. Riboflavin is a naturally occurring vitamin with a well-known and well-characterized safety profile.

Brucella spp., as animal pathogens, cause human brucellosis, a zoonosis that results in worldwide economic losses, human morbidity, and poverty. Although Brucella spp. infect humans as an incidental host, 500,000 new human infections occur annually, and no patient-friendly treatments or approved human vaccines are reported. Brucellae display strong tissue tropism for lymphoreticular and reproductive systems with an intracellular Lifestyle that Limits exposure to innate and adaptive immune responses, sequesters the organism from the effects of antibiotics, and drives clinical disease manifestations and pathology. Stealthy brucellae exploit strategies to establish infection, including i) evasion of intracellular destruction by restricting fusion of type IV secretion system-dependent Brucella-containing vacuoles with lysosomal compartments, ii) inhibition of apoptosis of infected mononuclear cells, and iii) prevention of dendritic cell maturation, antigen presentation, and activation of naive T cells, pathogenesis lessons that may be informative for other intracellular pathogens. Data sets of next-generation sequences of Brucella and host time-series global expression fused with proteomics and metabolomics data from in vitro and in vivo experiments now inform interactive cellular pathways and gene regulatory networks enabling full-scale systems biology analysis. The newly identified effector proteins of Brucella may represent targets for improved, safer brucellosis vaccines and therapeutics."

The properties and its role in the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease in humans and animals including food animals, companion animals and laboratory animals is presented. The importance of toxin A and toxin B in the pathogenicity of C. difficile is stressed. The major risk factor in provoking diarrhea is the use of antibiotics, particularly in hospitalized patients with increasing age, in the presence in the intestinal flora of C. difficile. Besides antibiotics, other conditions that may affect the intestinal flora are also favoring the development of the disease caused by C. difficile. The disease likewise occurs outside the hospital. As an etiological agent with a pathogenesis similar to that mentioned in humans, during the last years C. difficile is increasingly recognized in animals, as well. It is the most important cause of neonatal diarrhea in swine in some regions of the world. C. difficile infection in foals and mature horses may vary from a mild disease with diarrhea to a life-threatening disease. C. difficile has proved to be pathogenic for dogs and cats. According to the cited literature, while the transmission of C. difficile from animals to humans does take place, zoonotic activity of strains originating from animals has not been demonstrated."
4139,Joy,NO,NA,"Murray, DL; Cox, EW; Ballard, WB; Whitlaw, HA; Lenarz, MS; Custer, TW; Barnett, T; Fuller, TK",pathogens nutritional deficiency and climate influences on a declining moose population,2006,WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS,Web of Science,"Several potential proximate causes may be implicated in a recent (post-1984) decline in moose (Alces alces andersoni) numbers at their southern range periphery in northwest Minnesota, USA. These causes include deleterious effects of infectious pathogens, some of which are associated with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), negative effects of climate change, increased food competition with deer or moose, legal or illegal hunting, and increased predation by gray wolves (Canis lupus) and black bears (Ursus americanus). Long-standing factors that may have contributed to the moose decline include those typically associated with marginal habitat such as nutritional deficiencies. We examined survival and productivity among radiocollared (n= 152) adult female and juvenile moose in northwest Minnesota during 1995-2000, and assessed cause of death and pathology through carcass necropsy of radiocollared and non-radiocollared animals. Aerial moose surveys suggested that hunting was an unlikely source of the numerical decline because the level of harvest was relatively low (i.e., approx. 15%/2 yr) and the population usually grew in years following a hunt. The majority of moose mortalities (up to 87% of radiocollared moose [n = 76] and up to 65% of non-radiocollared moose [n = 84]) were proximally related to pathology associated with parasites and infectious disease. Liver fluke (Fascioloides magna) infections apparently constituted the greatest single source of mortality and caused significant pathology in the liver, thoracic and peritoneal cavities, pericardial sac, and lungs. Mortality due to meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) was less prevalent and was manifested through characteristic neurological disease. Several mortalities apparently were associated with unidentified infectious disease, probably acting in close association with malnutrition. Bone-marrow fat was lower for moose dying of natural causes than those dying of anthropogenic factors or accidents, implying that acute malnutrition contributed to moose mortality. Blood profiles from live-captured animals indicated that those dying in the subsequent 18 months were chronically malnourished. Relative to other populations, average annual survival rates for adult females (0.79 [0.74-0.84; 95% Cl]) and yearlings (0.64 [0.48-0.86]) were low, whereas those for calves (0.66 [0.53-081]) were high. Pregnancy (48%) and twinning (19%) rates were among the lowest reported for moose, with reproductive senescence among females being apparent as early as 8 years. Pregnancy status was related to indices of acute (i.e., bone-marrow fat) and chronic (i.e., blood condition indices) malnutrition. Opportunistic carcass recovery indicated that there likely were few prime-aged males (> 5 yr old) in the population. Analysis of protein content in moose browse and fecal samples indicated that food quality was probably adequate to support moose over winter, but the higher fecal protein among animals that died in the subsequent 18 months could be indicative of protein catabolism associated with malnutrition. Trace element analysis from moose livers revealed apparent deficiencies in copper and selenium, but there was limited evidence of direct association between trace element concentrations and moose disease, pathology, or mortality. Time-series analysis of regional moose counts (1961-2000) indicated that annual population growth rate was related negatively to mean summer temperature, with winter and summer temperatures increasing by an average of 6.8 and 2.1 C, respectively, during the 40-year period. This change may have increased moose thermoregulatory costs and disrupted their energy balance, and thereby reduced their fitness. Time-series analysis failed to show a relationship between annual population growth rate and moose or deer abundance, indicating that food limitation via resource competition was unlikely. Population viability analyses, using count data (1961-2000) and demographic data collected during this study, suggested that the northwest Minnesota moose population likely would not persist over the next 50 years. More broadly, we conclude that the southern distribution of moose may become restricted in areas where climate and habitat conditions are marginal, especially where deer are abundant and act as reservoir hosts for parasites."

However, in Europe and the U. S., two distinct phenomena; long-term declines in colony numbers and increasing annual colony losses, have led to significant interest in their causes and environmental implications. The most important drivers of a long-term decline in colony numbers appear to be socioeconomic and political pressure on honey production. In contrast, annual colony losses seem to be driven mainly by the spread of introduced pathogens and pests, and management problems due to a long-term intensification of production and the transition from large numbers of small apiaries to fewer, larger operations. We conclude that, while other causal hypotheses have received substantial interest, the role of pests, pathogens, and management issues requires increased attention."

Several organs/cell types may he infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. in this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors. it seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease."

The microbiology laboratory plays a crucial role in diagnosing infections, identifying the responsible infectious agents and establishing sensitivity of pathogens to drug therapy. Pathology, however, is the only way to correlate the presence of an infectious agent with the reaction it evokes at cell and tissue level. For pathologists working in the field of ID pathology, it is essential to dispose of competence in cell and tissue pathology as well as in microbiology. Expertise in ID includes understanding of taxonomy and classification of pathogens as well as morphological criteria supporting their identification. Moreover, ID pathologists must master the methods used to detect pathogens in fixed cell and tissue samples, notably immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction. Paradoxically, the increasing frequency of lesions caused by pathogens and diagnosed in a pathology laboratory appears to be paralleled by a gradual loss of expertise of pathologists in the field of infectious and tropical diseases. We contend that this may be due at least in part to the continuously increasing number of samples of tumor tissue pathologists deal with and the rapidly expanding number of tissue based biomarkers with predictive value for new anti-cancer therapies. In this review, we highlight current and future issues pertaining to ID pathology, in order to increase awareness of its importance for surgical and molecular pathology.

Improved lifestyle and quality of children's health is likely to reduce the burden of adult diseases and enhance longevity because seeds of most adult diseases are sown in childhood. Identification and decoding of human genome is expected to revolutionize the practice of pediatrics. The day is not far off when a patient will walk into doctor's chamber with an electronic or digital health history on a CD or palmtop and a decoded genomic constitution. There will be reduced burden of genetic diseases because of selective abortions of ""defective"" fetuses and replacement of ""bad"" genes with ""good"" ones by genetic engineering. Availability of totipotent stem cells and developments in transplant technology are likely to revolutionize the management of a variety of hematologic cancers and life-threatening genetic disorders. The possibility of producing flawless designer babies by advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) is likely to be mired by several ethical and legal issues. The availability of newer vaccines by recombinant technology for emerging infective and for non-infective lifestyle diseases is likely to improve survival and quality of life.

However, accessibility of research and evidence-based practices in these countries is not well characterized. This brief report determines the availability of professional veterinary journals within the Arabic-speaking region. METHODS An electronic search using 6 databases assessed for publication period, activity status, and available languages incorporated all aspects of veterinary medicine and specialties. RESULTS Among 29 veterinary journals identified, the oldest current publication originated 63 years ago, with 10 journals currently interrupted or ceased. All 19 currently active journals are available electronically as open access, with 8 also offered in paper format. Veterinary journals published within Arabic-speaking countries are predominantly produced in Egypt, Iraq, and Sudan. CONCLUSION Electronic access is lacking compared with English-speaking countries, and there is a lack of journals with an Arabic-language option. The reasons associated with language options in veterinary publications are not immediately apparent, yetmay highlight differences among public health, health education, and zoonotic professionals and the populations they serve. Veterinary journals in Arabic-speaking countries do not adequately represent the overall region and are limited in access. Further evaluation of regional culture and publisher preferences is indicated to identify new collaboration opportunities among health professionals and local stakeholders."

Given the recent outbreaks of contagious infectious diseases worldwide, including Ebola virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, there is urgent need for further research to determine optimal PPE use in high-risk settings. This review intends to provide a general understanding of PPE and to provide guidelines for appropriate use based on current evidence. Recent findings Although previous studies have focused on the efficacy of PPE in preventing transmission of pathogens, recent studies have examined the dangers to HCWs during removal of PPE when risk of contamination is highest. Access to adequate PPE supplies is crucial to preventing transmission of pathogens, especially in resource-limited settings. Adherence to appropriate PPE use is a challenge due to inadequate education on its usage, technical difficulties, and tolerability of PPE in the workplace. Future projects aim at ameliorating this situation, including redesigning PPE which is crucial to improving the safety of HCWs. Summary PPE remains the most important strategy for protecting HCW from potentially fatal pathogens. Further research into optimal PPE design and use to improve the safety of HCWs is urgently needed."

Tuberculosis, a major cause of chronic pulmonary infection, is currently responsible for approximately 1.5 million deaths per year. Although important advances in the fight against tuberculosis have been made, the progress towards eradication of this disease is being challenged by the dramatic increase in multidrug-resistant bacilli. Nontuberculous mycobacteria causing pulmonary disease and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis are emerging infectious diseases. In contrast to other infectious diseases, chronic respiratory infections share the trait of having highly variable treatment outcomes despite longstanding antimicrobial therapy. Recent scientific progress indicates that medicine is presently at a transition stage from programmatic to personalized management. We explain current state-of-the-art management concepts of chronic pulmonary infectious diseases as well as the underlying methods for therapeutic decisions and their implications for personalized medicine. Furthermore, we describe promising biomarkers and techniques with the potential to serve future individual treatment concepts in this field of difficult-to-treat patients. These include candidate markers to improve individual risk assessment for disease development, the design of tailor-made drug therapy regimens, and individualized biomarker-guided therapy duration to achieve relapse-free cure. In addition, the use of therapeutic drug monitoring to reach optimal drug dosing with the smallest rate of adverse events as well as candidate agents for future host-directed therapies are described.

The high circulation rate of Bordetella pertussis poses a threat to infants that have not been ( completely) vaccinated and for whom pertussis is a severe, life-threatening, disease. The increase in pertussis is mainly found in age groups in which immunity has waned and this has resulted in the perception that waning immunity is the main or exclusive cause for the resurgence of pertussis. However, significant changes in B. pertussis populations have been observed after the introduction of vaccinations, suggesting a role for pathogen adaptation in the persistence and resurgence of pertussis. These changes include antigenic divergence with vaccine strains and increased production of pertussis toxin. Antigenic divergence will affect both memory recall and the efficacy of antibodies, while higher levels of pertussis toxin may increase suppression of the innate and acquired immune system. We propose these adaptations of B. pertussis have decreased the period in which pertussis vaccines are effective and thus enhanced the waning of immunity. We plead for a more integrated approach to the pertussis problem which includes the characteristics of the vaccines, the B. pertussis populations and the interaction between the two."

Actinobacteria from terrestrial sources have been studied and screened since the 1950s, for many important antibiotics, anticancer, antitumor and immunosuppressive agents. However, frequent rediscovery of the same compounds from the terrestrial actinobacteria has made them less attractive for screening programs in the recent years. At the same time, actinobacteria isolated from the marine environment have currently received considerable attention due to the structural diversity and unique biological activities of their secondary metabolites. They are efficient producers of new secondary metabolites that show a range of biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antitumor, cytotoxic, cytostatic, anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic, anti-malaria, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-angiogenesis, etc. In this review, an evaluation is made on the current status of research on marine actinobacteria yielding pharmaceutically active secondary metabolites.

The pathogenic organisms are members of the genus Echinococcus (Cestoda: Taeniidae). Life cycles of Echinococcus spp. are consistently dependent on predator-prey association between two obligate mammalian hosts. Carnivores (canids and felids) serve as definitive hosts for adult tapeworms and their herbivore prey (ungulates, rodents and lagomorphs) as intermediate hosts for metacestode larvae. Humans are involved as an accidental host for metacestode infections. The metacestodes develop in various internal organs, particularly in liver and lungs. Each metacestode of Echinococcus spp. has an organotropism and a characteristic form known as an unilocular (cystic), alveolar or polycystic hydatid. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the type species, Echinococcus granulosus, causing cystic echinococcosis is a cryptic species complex. Therefore, the orthodox taxonomy of Echinococcus established from morphological criteria has been revised from the standpoint of phylogenetic systematics. Nine valid species including newly resurrected taxa are recognised as a result of the revision. This review summarises the recent advances in the phylogenetic systematics of Echinococcus, together with the historical backgrounds and molecular epidemiological aspects of each species. A new phylogenetic tree inferred from the mitochondrial genomes of all valid Echinococcus spp. is also presented.

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete cytochrome b gene (1140 bp) of 23 individuals from six localities in Sudan (from two previously recognized species, Arvicanthis niloticus and Arvicanthis testicularis), supported the existence of only a single species, A. niloticus, from the Nile Valley. Historical demography of the Sudanese Nile Valley population inferred from mismatch coefficients indicated that an exponential population expansion event occurred approximately 144 000-288 000 years ago, corresponding in time with early human expansion and colonization from Africa to the Middle East, Europe, and the world. The inferred high level of gene flow and large size of Sudanese Nile populations of A. niloticus is consistent with historically recent (300 years ago) exponential human population growth and intense agricultural activity inferred from archaeological and historical evidence. Two African Arvicanthis clades were well supported by the broader phylogenetic analysis: (1) A. niloticus, Arvicanthis abyssinicus and Arvicanthis neumanni and (2) Arvicanthis rufinus and Arvicanthis ansorgei from western Africa.

Platelet derivatives have been proposed as FBS substitutes for the ex-vivo expansion of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) since platelet-derived growth factors can promote MSC ex-vivo expansion. Platelet-derived growth factors are present in platelet lysate (PL) obtained after repeated freezing-thawing cycles of the platelet-rich plasma or by applying physiological stimuli such as thrombin or CaCl2. PL-expanded MSCs have been used already in the clinic, taking advantage of their faster proliferation compared with FBS-expanded preparations. Should PL be applied to other biopharmaceutical products, its demand is likely to increase dramatically. The use of fresh platelet units for the production of PL raises concerns due to limited availability of platelet donors. Expired units might represent an alternative, but further data are needed to define safety, including pathogen reduction, and functionality of the obtained PL. In addition, relevant questions concerning the definition of PL release criteria, including concentration ranges of specific growth factors in PL batches for various clinical indications, also need to be addressed. We are still far from a common definition of PL and standardized PL manufacture due to our limited knowledge of the mechanisms that mediate PL-promoting cell growth. Here, we concisely discuss aspects of PL as MSC culture supplement as a preliminary step towards an agreed definition of the required characteristics of PL for the requirements of manufacturers and users."

Although present throughout the world, about 90% of the cases occur in Asia where around 20 million people are infected. The parasitic cycle is complex with two different intermediate hosts. Man is infected by ingesting the raw or undercooked flesh of the second host - a freshwater crab or prawn - or possibly of a paratenic mammal host (wild boar), which contains the infective larval stage metacercariae that reaches the lung which is the main target organ. Epidemiological, pathological, and clinical aspects are reviewed. The main symptoms are protracted cough, and recurrent ""benign"" hemoptysis. Abnormal pleuro-pulmonary imaging features are constant, but protean and non-specific, leading to frequent confusion with tuberculosis. Diagnosis is easily achieved by ova search in the sputum or pleural fluid, or by serology. Evolution is usually considered benign, although not well known. Finally, praziquantel is the effective first choice treatment. Some paradoxical aspects of this disease are underlined such as: underdiagnosis despite a very simple diagnostic procedure, or opposite tendencies according to location, either extinction or re-emergence.

On continents and large islands (collectively termed ""mainlands""), cats are responsible for very high mortality of vertebrates. Nevertheless, cat population management is traditionally contentious and usually involves proving that cats reduce prey population sizes. We synthesize the available evidence of the negative effects of cats on mainland vertebrates. More than a dozen observational studies, as well as experimental research, provide unequivocal evidence that cats are capable of affecting multiple population-evel processes among mainland vertebrates. In addition to predation, cats affect vertebrate populations through disease and fear-related effects, and they reduce population sizes, suppress vertebrate population sizes below their respective carrying capacities, and alter demographic processes such as source-sink dynamics. Policy discussions should shift from requiring ""proof of impact"" to a precautionary approach that emphasizes evidence-driven management to reduce further impacts from outdoor cats."

Porcine intestinal epithelial cells more closely mimic human physiology than analogous rodent cell lines (e.g. IEC-6 or IEC-18), which is important in studies of zoonotic infections; in addition, they provide specificity to study porcine-derived infections. IPEC-J2 cells are increasingly being used in microbiological studies to examine the interactions of various animal and human pathogens, including Salmonella enterica and pathogenic Escherichia coli, with intestinal epithelial cells.

The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR-preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays-and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases."

Human deaths are the most important direct economic impact of canine rabies, followed by livestock losses and the cost of PEP, while expenses associated with dog vaccination and control are major indirect impacts. The global burden of rabies disproportionately affects Asia, which experiences more than half of human rabies deaths and approximately 65% of livestock losses, and performs more than 90% of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Africa is second to Asia in terms of human deaths and livestock losses, but administers the least number of PEPs of the three regions. Recent experience in Latin America shows that efforts to reduce human deaths from rabies through expanded dog vaccination and improved access to PEP result in significant monetary savings. The elimination of canine rabies would lead to major economic benefits in developing countries that are often the least capable of dealing with the disease.

In this review paper, we discuss the pathophysiology of increased sympathetic nerve activity in CKD patients and raise the possibility of endurance exercise being an effective countermeasure to address this problem. We specifically focus on the potential role of endurance training in altering renal sympathetic nerve activity as increased renal sympathetic nerve activity negatively impacts kidney function as well indirectly effects multiple other systems and organs. Recent technological advances in device based therapy have highlighted the detrimental effect of elevated renal sympathetic nerve activity in CKD patients, with kidney function and blood pressure being improved post renal artery nerve denervation in selected patients. These developments provide optimism for the development of alternative and/or complementary strategies to lower renal sympathetic nerve activity. However, appropriately designed studies are required to confirm preliminary observations, as the widespread use of the renal denervation approach to lower sympathetic activity presently has limited feasibility. Endurance training may be one alternative strategy to reduce renal sympathetic nerve activity. Here we review the role of endurance training as a potential alternative or adjunctive to current therapy in CKD patients. We also provide recommendations for future research to assist in establishing an evidence base for the use of endurance training to lower renal sympathetic activity in CKD patients.

The OneHealth approach integrates these and further elements into considerations to improve disease control and prevention. Food of animal origin for human consumption is another integral aspect; if produced from infected livestock such items may act as vehicles of spread of animal pathogens, and, in case of zoonotic agents, as a potential human health hazard. Notifiable zoonotic avian influenza viruses (AIV) have become entrenched in poultry populations in several Asian and northern African countries since 2003. Highly pathogenic (HP) AIV (e.g. H5NI) cause extensive poultry mortality and severe economic losses. HPAIV and low pathogenic AIV (e.g. H7N9) with zoonotic propensities pose risks for human health. More than 1500 human cases of AIV infection have been reported, mainly from regions with endemically infected poultry. Intense human exposure to AIV-infected poultry, e.g. during rearing, slaughtering or processing of poultry, is a major risk factor for acquiring AIV infection. In contrast, human infections through consumption of AIV-contaminated food have not been substantiated. Heating poultry products according to kitchen standards (core temperatures >70 degrees C, >10 s) rapidly inactivates AIV infectivity and renders fully cooked products safe. Nevertheless, concerted efforts must ensure that poultry products potentially contaminated with zoonotic AIV do not reach the food chain.

Environmental scanning, foresight programmes, horizon scanning and surveillance are used to collect and assess information for rapidly responding to EIDs and to anticipate drivers of emergence for mitigating future EID impacts. Prioritization of EIDs - using transparent and repeatable methods - based on disease impacts and the importance of those impacts to decision-makers can then be used for more efficient resource allocation for prevention and control. Risk assessment and simulation modelling methods assess the likelihood of EIDs occurring, define impact and identify mitigation strategies.

Most exhibit low pathogenicity and only rarely high pathogenicity in poultry (and humans). During the past few years infections of poultry and humans with H7 subtypes have increased markedly. This review summarizes the emergence of avian influenza virus H7 subtypes in birds and humans, and the possibilities of its control in poultry. All H7Nx combinations were reported from wild birds, the natural reservoir of the virus. Geographically, the most prevalent subtype is H7N7, which is endemic in wild birds in Europe and was frequently reported in domestic poultry, whereas subtype H7N3 is mostly isolated from the Americas. In humans, mild to fatal infections were caused by subtypes H7N2, H7N3, H7N7 and H7N9. While infections of humans have been associated mostly with exposure to domestic poultry, infections of poultry have been linked to wild birds or live-bird markets. Generally, depopulation of infected poultry was the main control tool; however, inactivated vaccines were also used. In contrast to recent cases caused by subtype H7N9, human infections were usually self-limiting and rarely required antiviral medication. Close genetic and antigenic relatedness of H7 viruses of different origins may be helpful in development of universal vaccines and diagnostics for both animals and humans. Due to the wide spread of H7 viruses and their zoonotic importance more research is required to better understand the epidemiology, pathobiology and virulence determinants of these viruses and to develop improved control tools."

Since the first indication of scrapie infectivity and the experimental transmission of the scrapie agent in 1937, prions and their associated transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have been under constant investigation. TSEs are neurodegenerative and fatal diseases with no early diagnosis, treatment or cure. Despite their diverse presentations, all TSEs stem from the infectious, spontaneous or hereditary conversion of the host-encoded cellular prion protein PrPC into the pathogenic isoform PrPSc. Based on the prion hypothesis, Pr Pc has the autocatalytic or induced capacity to change its secondary configuration from a mainly alpha-helix structure into predominant beta-sheet configuration. Another enigmatic aspect of the prion biology is the potential physiological function of PrPC, a protein that is widely distributed in mammalian tissues and intensely expressed in the nervous system. Pr Pc has been associated to several biological roles including cellular adhesion, protection and differentiation. The unpredictable properties of the PrPSc and the complex presentation of TSEs have opened many questions yet to be answered. The potential zoonotic transmission of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has generated intense concern in the international community over animal product biosecurity. During the last years, research in prion biology has mainly focused on determination of the pathogenesis of TSEs and the development of diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

Human prion diseases can be sporadic, acquired or hereditary. Acquired priors diseases have been linked to entering contaminated food into the human food chain, failure to completely disinfect or sterilize contaminated surgical instruments, patients receiving tissues and organs from infected donors, recipients of blood and other biological contaminated products, and potentially to cross infection in dental procedures. At present, there is unfortunately no efficient therapy that can be administered to clinically infected patients with prion diseases. Moreover, there are no simple diagnostic tests that can be used to show the agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy during the preclinical phase of the disease.

We reviewed the medical literature for cases of Legionnaires' disease in children and analysed the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment. 76 cases of legionella infection in children were identified. In 56%, diagnosis was made with culture methodology. 46% were community-acquired infections. 51.5% were under 2 years of age. 78% of the patients had an underlying condition such as malignancy. Fever, cough, and tachypnoea were the most common symptoms. The overall mortality rate was 33% and was higher in immunosuppressed children and in children younger than the age of 1 year. Patients who were treated empirically with anti-legionella therapy had a notably lower mortality rate compared with patients on inappropriate therapy (23% vs 70%). In 88% of hospital-acquired cases, an environmental link to potable water colonised with legionella was identified. We found no clinical features unique to Legionnaires' disease in children that would allow differentiation from pneumonia due to other respiratory pathogens. Awareness of legionella as a potential cause of paediatric pneumonia is particularly important because infection can be severe and life threatening and antimicrobial therapy often used for empirical therapy in children is not effective against legionella. In any case of pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics, Legionnaires' disease should be considered and specific diagnostic tests to verify this diagnosis should be done. As legionella diagnostic tests become more widely applied, we predict that legionellosis may appear as an emerging infectious disease in children."

This review will highlight developments with potential impact on donor and recipient screening and pretransplant management. Recent findings Key findings regarding bacterial infections include the lack of utility of mupirocin intranasal decolonization for prevention of Staphylococcus aureus infections after liver transplantation, and the description of transmission of Pseudomonas infection to multiple recipients via an innominate artery graft. The implications of donor bacterial colonization in lung transplantation are further explored. The emergence of non-Candida albicans yeast and non-Aspergillus mold infections may lead to changes in prophylactic strategies. The majority of cystic fibrosis patients have had Aspergillus colonization at some time before transplant; one-quarter of these develop tracheobronchial aspergillosis and anastomotic complications. There are several key developments regarding viral infections. Donor-derived human herpesvirus-8-infected neoplastic cells have been identified in recipients with Kaposi sarcoma. The transmission of human T-cell lymphotropic virus -1 (HTLV-1) to multiple recipients who developed myelopathy underscores the continuing need for donor screening. The striking event of West Nile virus transmission to multiple recipients from a single donor also has raised questions regarding donor screening for this virus. New information on the use of hepatitis B core antibody-positive donor livers, as well as the emergence of hepatitis B virus escape mutants, is discussed. Finally, information on successful retransplantation after BK polyomavirus (BKV) allograft nephropathy is beginning to appear. Summary The pretransplant phase continues to be an important time period for screening and intervention in order to reduce the risk of posttransplant infections. Recent findings add to our current understanding of epidemiology and risk stratification; however, more randomized trials are needed."

The disease most frequently manifests clinically as a self-limited febrile illness, as pneumonia (acute Q fever) or as a chronic illness that presents mainly as infective endocarditis. The extreme infectivity of the bacterium results in large outbreaks, and the recent outbreak in the Netherlands underlines its impact on public health. Recent studies on the bacterium have included genome sequencing, the investigation of host-bacterium interactions, the development of cellular and animal models of infection, and the comprehensive analysis of different clinical isolates by whole genome and proteomic approaches. Current approaches for diagnosing Q fever are based on serological methods and PCR techniques, but the diagnosis of early stage disease lacks specificity and sensitivity. Consequently, different platforms have been created to explore Q fever biomarkers. Several studies using a combination of proteomics and recombinant protein screening approaches have been undertaken for the development of diagnostics and vaccines.

The surveillance systems detect a variety of events, or ""signals"" which represent a potential risk, such as a novel germ, a pathogen which may disseminate in a non-endemic area, or an abnormal number of cases for a well-known disease. These signals are first verified and analyzed, then classified as: potential public health threat, event to follow-up, or absence of threat. Through various examples, we illustrate the method and criteria which are used to analyze and classify these events considered to be emerging. The examples highlight the importance of host characteristics and exposure in groups at particular risk, such as professionals in veterinarian services, health care workers, travelers, immunodepressed patients, etc. The described method should allow us to identify future needs in terms of surveillance and to improve timeliness, quality of expertise, and feedback information regarding the public health risk posed by events which are insufficiently documented.

The natural reservoirs are small rodents, hares, and possibly amoebas in water. The etiological agent, Francisella tularensis, is a non-spore forming, encapsulated, facultative intracellular bacterium, a member of the gamma-Proteobacteria class of Gram-negative bacteria. Francisella tularensis is capable of invading and replicating within phagocytic as well as non-phagocytic cells and modulate inflammatory response. Infection by the pulmonary, dermal, or oral routes, respectively, results in pneumonic, ulceroglandular, or oropharyngeal tularemia. The highest mortality rates are associated with the pneumonic form of this disease. All members of Francisella tularensis species cause more or less severe disease Due to their abilities to be transmitted to humans via multiple routes and to be disseminated via biological aerosol that can cause the disease after inhalation of even an extremely low infectious dose, Francisella tularensis has been classified as a Category A bioterrorism agent.

The paper highlighted what was already a familiar clinical presentation ""which taxes our resources to the utmost"". Fast-forward through 90 years of careful clinical description, technological innovation in diagnosis and treatment, emergent infections, novel diagnoses, demographic shifts, and radical changes in the health economy. Sir Thomas would find certain aspects familiar, and others revolutionary, in the differential diagnosis and management of the 21st century patient with pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO). Within high-income settings, the proportion of cases due to infection has declined, albeit unevenly. The era of untreated HIV, and the consequences of iatrogenic intervention and immunosuppression, led to Durack and Street's subclassification of the condition in the early 1990s into classic, nosocomial, neutropenic and HIV-associated PUO. Shifts towards ambulatory care have driven a change in the definition of many diseases. An era of observant clinicians, who lent their names to eponymous syndromes, followed by meticulous serological, genetic and clinicopathological correlation, generated a battery of diagnoses that, along with malignancy, form a large proportion of diagnoses in more recent clinical care. In the current era, universal access to cross-sectional imaging and an infinite array of laboratory tests has undermined the attention paid to history and examination. In some areas of the clinical assessment, such as assessing the fever pattern, this shift is supported by research evidence. The issues that need to be addressed in the next 90 years of technological innovation, information sharing and health service transformation are likely to include: transcriptomic approaches to diagnosis; the place of positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnostic pathway; the optimal management of high ferritin states; and the most cost-effective diagnostic environment, in the face of this era of specialisation and fragmentation of care. In the meantime, this review covers some important early 21st century lessons to be shared in avoiding diagnostic pitfalls and choosing empirical therapy."

The establishment and spread of such invasive species has caused significant damage to the economy, the environment, and human or native species health. This review compiles information on infections or contact with pathogens reported in raccoons (Procyon lotor). Raccoons are opportunistic carnivores native to North America. However, nowadays they are distributed across mainland Europe as a result of escaped pets and introductions. In their native range, raccoons are known to be host to a number of disease agents that could be transmitted to humans, domestic animals and other wildlife. Hence, the increase of raccoon populations and their geographic spread in Europe may result in new disease hazards. Raccoons have been identified as possible sentinels of diseases such as West Nile virus, and they pose a disease-related conservation risk by maintaining circulation of canine distemper virus. They also have the potential to participate in the maintenance of zoonoses including the raccoon roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis. Due its fast expansion and the large list of diseases, we conclude that the introduction of the raccoon has had adverse effects on health in Europe. This might well be the case of other invasive species, too. Hence, studies on invasive species health aspects are urgently needed to assess the risk of disease spread and eventually establish control measures."

We first outline the known picture of the distribution of the house mouse in Africa. We then describe the ongoing range expansion of the house mouse in Senegal, in order to update its distribution area, assess the location of the invasion front, describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of the invasion at the country scale and evaluate its impact on native small mammal communities. We briefly review the worldwide status of the house mouse, with special focus on its situation in Africa. Focusing on Senegal, we then use historical records and a large body of spatio-temporal indoor trapping data obtained from small mammal communities over the last 30 years to analyse the invasion dynamics of the subspecies at the scale of the country. The geographic range of the invasive house mouse is surprisingly poorly known in Africa. In Senegal, we document a large range expansion of the subspecies in human settlements over the whole country within the last 30 years. The invasion is still ongoing further east and south within the country, and has major consequences for small mammal communities and thus probably for risks associated with zoonotic diseases."

Emerging infectious diseases may decimate populations or become endemic, but such worst-case scenarios do not occur as frequently as might be expected, even for virulent parasites. 2. One explanation for this apparent paradox is that rapid evolution of host resistance may diminish or terminate epidemics. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that evolution in host-parasite systems can dramatically alter the prevalence and intensity of infection. 3. The potential for rapid evolution to protect host populations from negative effects of virulent parasites depends on the type of parasite-driven evolution that occurs. In some host-parasite systems, evolution of increased host resistance can terminate epidemics. However, evolution resulting from parasite-mediated disruptive selection might actually allow a disease to persist in the host population. Epidemics may also be sustained through coevolution of the parasite. 4. The rate of evolution and subsequent disease dynamics will be affected by both the diversity of the host population and the community context in which the host-parasite interaction is embedded. Predators, competitors and food resources can all affect the rates of evolution of hosts and parasites and interact with evolution to determine the outcome of epidemics. 5. Freshwater organisms have played an important role in the studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Rapid evolution in response to parasitism has been demonstrated in multiple freshwater host species, which appears to have protected some of these populations from the virulent effects of infectious diseases. 6. Studies of emerging infectious diseases in freshwater ecosystems should consider the possibility of evolution of hosts and/or parasites on ecological timescales, since this phenomenon can profoundly affect disease dynamics."

The use of nanoparticles has provided a tremendous opportunity to design vaccine delivery systems that are efficient in targeted delivery, providing stability to antigens, and act as efficient adjuvants. Many of the nanoparticles are able to enter the antigen presenting cells by different pathways and induce appropriate immune responses to the antigen. A number of different nanoparticles are used in fish vaccine delivery, which includes biodegradable polymers, nanoliposomes, carbon nanotubes, calcium phosphate, and immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs), among which poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and chitosan are the most studied form of nanoparticles to date.

They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity."

Activity in this field was highlighted by the eighth International Symposium on Phlebotomine Sand flies (ISOPS) held in September 2014, which prompted this review focusing on vector control. Topics reviewed include: Taxonomy and phylogenetics, Vector competence, Genetics, genomics and transcriptomics, Eco-epidemiology, and Vector control. Research on sand flies as leishmaniasis vectors has revealed a diverse array of zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission cycles, mostly in subtropical and tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America, but also in Mediterranean Europe. The challenge is to progress beyond descriptive eco-epidemiology, in order to separate vectors of biomedical importance from the sand fly species that are competent vectors but lack the vectorial capacity to cause much human disease. Transmission modelling is required to identify the vectors that are a public health priority, the ones that must be controlled as part of the integrated control of leishmaniasis. Effective modelling of transmission will require the use of entomological indices more precise than those usually reported in the leishmaniasis literature."

The infection may be fatal if proper treatment is not provided; hence, early diagnosis is very important. Currently, ELISA and immunoblotting are the most reliable tests for serodiagnositic purposes, although their accuracy is largely dependent on the quality of the antigenic source used. Hydatid cyst fluid has been the antigenic extract of choice for primary immunodiagnosis of the disease, which is mainly based on the detection of antigens B and 5. Several problems are associated with this extract, however, including a lack of sensitivity and specificity, and difficulties with standardization of its use. This paper reviews recent advances in the identification and characterization of novel antigens that may be useful for the immunodiagnosing of human cystic echinococcosis, with emphasis on progress in recombinant technologies and synthetic peptides. Novel approaches are discussed, such as the design of antigenic extracts from other developmental stages of the parasite, as well as the usefulness of serum cytokine detection in the clinical follow-up of affected patients after surgical or pharmacological treatment."

Owing to excellent public health measures that isolated focus cases and their contacts, and the use of supportive therapies, the epidemic was suppressed to the point that further cases have not appeared since 2005. However, despite intensive research since then (over 3500 publications), it remains an untreatable disease. The potential for re-emergence of the SARS-CoV or a similar virus with unknown but potentially serious consequences remains high. This is due in part to the extreme genetic variability of RNA viruses such as the coronaviruses, the many animal reservoirs that seem to be able host the SARS-CoV in which reassortment or recombination events could occur and the ability coronaviruses have to transmit relatively rapidly from species to species in a short period of time. Thus, it seems prudent to continue to explore and develop antiviral chemotherapies to treat SARS-CoV infections. To this end, the various efficacious anti-SARS-CoV therapies recently published from 2007 to 2010 are reviewed in this article. In addition, compounds that have been tested in various animal models and were found to reduce virus lung titers and/or were protective against death in lethal models of disease, or otherwise have been shown to ameliorate the effects of viral infection, are also reported."

It is shown that neither the reputed current expansion of the ranges of main TBE vectors, the taiga (Ixodes persulcatus) and sheep (Ixodes ricinus) ticks, nor the significant rise of their abundance and TBE virus prevalence in them are confirmed by any objective data. The concept of recent tick expansion to large cities and human TBE infection in newly formed urban foci disagrees with the facts repeatedly described during the past four decades. There is no reliable information on the expansion of TBE nosological range. The influence of newly formed anthropurgic foci and of changes in the contribution of city dwellers to the general morbidity structure on the current epidemiological situation is estimated. As in the case of any other zoonosis with natural focality, the level of epidemiological manifestation of TBE foci is determined by two main parameters: the intensity of virus circulation in the foci (i.e., their loimopotential) and the frequency of human contact with them. Attention is paid to the character of interaction between these two factors, which accounted for a major outbreak of TBE morbidity at the end of the twentieth century, followed by a long-term decrease in its level."

There are two distinct variants of ABLV, one that circulates in frugivorous bats (genus Pteropus) and the other in insectivorous microbats (genus Saccolaimus). Three fatal human cases of ABLV infection have been reported, the most recent in 2013, and each manifested as acute encephalitis but with variable incubation periods. Importantly, two equine cases also arose recently in 2013, the first occurrence of ABLV in a species other than bats or humans. Similar to other rhabdoviruses, ABLV infects host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent pH-dependent fusion facilitated by its single fusogenic envelope glycoprotein (G). Recent studies have revealed that proposed rabies virus (RABV) receptors are not sufficient to permit ABLV entry into host cells and that the unknown receptor is broadly conserved among mammalian species. However, despite clear tropism differences between ABLV and RABV, the two viruses appear to utilize similar endocytic entry pathways. The recent human and horse infections highlight the importance of continued Australian public health awareness of this emerging pathogen."

The need for a global system that connects the national and international regulatory levels within a coherent framework is emphasized. Recent findings Recent progress in preclinical xenotransplantation of pancreatic islets has enhanced the hopes of providing patients with safe and effective treatments from animal cells and tissues in the near future. At the same time the increasing number of clinical trials proposed and sometimes authorized calls for attention from regulatory authorities. Summary Although the main regulatory aspects of xenotransplantation have been identified since the early 1990s, regulatory problems connected to the promising scientific data published in the field of pancreatic islets still require attention. In fact most normative issues, such as criteria for patients' enrollment in clinical trials and the management of safety measures have been primarily explored in relation to solid organ transplantation. Also the issue of animal rights has become more compelling in relation to the treatment of nonhuman primates in preclinical trials. In these rapidly evolving conditions the establishment of agreed guidelines at both the national and international levels remains the most urgent goal to be achieved."

Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like the recent porcine Influenza A virus (H1N1) pandemic necessitated the availability of unprecedented amounts of vaccines. In addition, the high demand for vaccines in the industrialised countries has also been paralleled by a steep increase in demand in developing countries. The manufacturing capability for viral vaccines produced in embryonated hen eggs and conventional/classical cell substrates, such as chicken embryo fibroblasts, has now reached its capacity limit. This constraint may be overcome by utilising other recognised cell substrates such as Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) (dog origin), Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) (hamster cells) or Vero cells (monkey origin) or as an alternative, introduce new cell substrates of human or avian origin. Using new cell substrates may prove to be a highly replication-proficient way of producing live viral vaccines such as Influenza A viruses. Despite some advantages, cell substrates may pose a small residual risk to human:; since some of them are known to be tumourigenic in immunosuppressed animals. However, this residual risk should be considered acceptable by regulators. Safety testing requirements for cell substrates used in the manufacture of vaccines is mandated by published guidance from organisations such as World Health Organization (WHO), United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and International Conferences on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human use (ICH) as well as requirements laid down in compendia! monographs (Ph. Eur. and USP). This paper considers the guidance contained in these regulatory documents. In addition, the safety challenges and almost arbitrary risk-based classification of cell substrates used in the production of human vaccines together with compliance to GCCP (Good Cell Culture Practice) are discussed. Even though there has been tremendous progress in the last few years, reflected mainly by revisions and updates to regulatory guidance documents, there still is still no consensus between regulators nor significant harmonisation of the guidance documents or monographs.

Indeed, the term 'relapsing fever' was first used to describe clinical cases of this disease in Edinburgh. During the last century, we have witnessed the demise of the louse-borne infection, largely through improving standards of living resulting in a reduction in body lice, the vector for Borrelia recurrentis [louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)]. The tick-borne zoonotic form of the disease persists in endemic foci around the world [tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF)]. Indeed, TBRF is reportedly the most common bacterial infection from Senegal and listed within the top ten causes of mortality in children under five in Tanzania. In Ethiopia, LBRF is again within the top ten causes of hospital admission, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite these figures, many now regard relapsing fever as an unusual tropical disease. Certainly, recent cases have been imported following travel from endemic zones. More surprisingly, cases have been reported following family reunions in Colorado, USA. A further case was reported from the Mt Wilson observatory in Los Angeles, USA. In many regions, the infection is zoonotic with natural reservoirs in several vertebrate species. In West Africa, infection is again primarily zoonotic. Whether those species found predominantly in East Africa are zoonoses or are infections of humans alone is still debated, however, the life cycle may be determined by the feeding preferences of their arthropod vectors."

The bacterial contamination of milk from the affected cows render it unfit for human consumption and provides a mechanism of spread of diseases like tuberculosis, sore-throat, Q-fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis etc. and has zoonotic importance. Somatic cell count (SCC) is a useful predictor of intramammary infection (IMI) that includes leucocytes (75%) i.e. neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, erythrocytes and epithelial cells (25%). Leucocytes increase in response to bacterial infection, tissue injury and stress. Somatic cells are protective for the animal body and fight infectious organisms. An elevated SCC in milk has a negative influence on the quality of raw milk. Subclinical mastitis is always related to low milk production, changes to milk consistency (density), reduced possibility of adequate milk processing, low protein and high risk for milk hygiene since it may even contain pathogenic organisms.

Most studies that focused on human and livestock health were cross-sectional whereas wildlife health studies were mostly case reports. Fifteen diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health were identified and 21 diseases were identified as notifiable to either the Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare or the Korea Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Two diseases were reported as occurring as epidemics; highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and virulent Newcastle disease. Six diseases or disease agents were described in the literature as emerging including HPAI, rabies, Babesia microti, avian coronaviruses, scrub typhus, and severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome virus. The diseases for which there were the largest number of publications were HPAI and rabies.

In contrast, there were few publications on diseases of concern for wildlife populations or research to understand the impacts of these diseases for wildlife management. Increased focus on prospective studies would enhance understanding of disease dynamics in wildlife populations.

Vertebrate taxa that appear to be most affected by these diseases are amphibians and birds, though this may be a consequence of research effort. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) affecting psittacine bird species is the disease of concern here. Data on BFDV incidence in wild, endangered Cape parrots (Poicephalus robustus) were collected opportunistically from 1992 to 2014. Data show that the disease is prevalent naturally in the wild during extreme climatic events, including drought. This stresses the birds, which may result in the expression of pathological symptoms.

Rampant rise in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions drives the big wheel of climate change which affects human societies, animal habitats and woodlands by flash floods, glacial melts, acidic rains, droughts, famines, wildfires, epidemics, heat and cold waves. South Asia is one of the most severely affected regions on the planet due to its demographics. The per capita impact of climate change on the millions of Pakistanis is very high compared to their diminutive per capita share of global GHG emissions. Environmental issues of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries include deforestation, air pollution, desertification, glacial melts, sea level rise, water contamination and loss of biodiversity. Pakistan is among the top ten countries worst hit by climate change, where native populations of lions, leopards, dolphins, tortoise and vultures face extinction threat. Acacia and rosewood tree forests in Sindh, Punjab and Pak-Afghan precincts have already dried by dieback disease during 1998-2005. Hundreds of people succumb to death annually by heat waves in South during summer and cold waves in North during winter. Climate change is a global phenomenon; nevertheless, higher GHG emissions first affect local and regional territories and later impact worldwide. Pakistan's CO2 emissions are greater than least developed SAARC countries but much lower than the nearby Himalayan slope countries. This paper reports impact of CO2 emissions on society, forests, crops and wildlife in Pakistan recounting adaptation and mitigation strategies in SAARC countries. We present simulation results for a future super smart grid connecting Central Asian States (CAS) to SAARC countries for bilateral electricity trade, progress in carbon capture and storage technologies in SAARC countries, and original research on utilizing CO2 (R744) for water heating in extremely cold regions."

In 2004, the Chinese Ministry of Health estimated that 380,000 people had the disease in the region. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is highly co-endemic with both alveolar echinococcosis (AE) and cystic echinococcosis (CE). In the past years, the Chinese government has been increasing the financial support to control the diseases in this region. Therefore, it is very important to identify the significant risk factors of the diseases by reviewing studies done in the region in the past decade to help policymakers design appropriate control strategies. Review: Selection criteria for which literature to review were firstly defined. Medline, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Google Scholar were systematically searched for literature published between January 2000 and July 2011. Significant risk factors found by single factor and/or multiple factors analysis were listed, counted, and summarized. Literature was examined to check the comparability of the data; age and sex specific prevalence with same data structures were merged and used for further analysis. A variety of assumed social, economical, behavioral, and ecological risk factors were studied on the Plateau. Those most at risk were Tibetan herdsmen, the old and female in particular. By analyzing merged comparable data, it was found that females had a significant higher prevalence, and a positive linearity relationship existed between echinococcosis prevalence and increasing age. In terms of behavioral risk factors, playing with dogs was mostly correlated with CE and/or AE prevalence. In terms of hygiene, employing ground water as the drinking water source was significantly correlated with CE and AE prevalence. For definitive hosts, dog related factors were most frequently identified with prevalence of CE or/and AE; fox was a potential risk factor for AE prevalence only. Overgrazing and deforestation were significant for AE prevalence only. Conclusion: Tibetan herdsmen communities were at the highest risk of echinococcosis prevalence and should be the focus of echinococcosis control. Deworming both owned and stray dogs should be a major measure for controlling echinococcosis; treatment of wild definitive hosts should also be considered for AE endemic areas. Health education activities should be in concert with the local people's education backgrounds and languages in order to be able to improve behaviors. Further researches are needed to clarify the importance of wild hosts for AE/CE prevalence, the extent and range of the impacts of ecologic changes (overgrazing and deforestation) on the AE prevalence, and risk factors in Tibet."

The prevalence rate (5-10%) in Turkana, Northern Kenya is among the highest worldwide. With an increase in foreign travel and migration of peoples, practitioners need to be aware of diseases common in these countries and their rarer manifestations. The objective of this study was to review the management of this disease in a poorly resourced high-prevalence area. Methods The surgical records of Kakuma Mission Hospital, Turkana from July 1981 to May 2002 were reviewed. Results A total of 710 (female: male, 3:2) surgical procedures for hydatid disease were recorded, the average age being 27 years (range, 3-65 years). There were 663 patients, and therefore 47 patients had repeat procedures. A total of 52.8% (n = 375) had hepatic cysts (248 right sided, 30 left sided, 97 site undefined), and 10.1% (n = 72) had multiple abdominal cysts. Other intra-abdominal sites included 8.16% mesenteric (n = 58), 2.9% retroperitoneal (n = 21), 3.5% spleen (n = 25), the abdominal wall (n = 4). There was no information on the site of disease in 5.9% of cases (n = 42). More unusual sites were retro-orbital, gluteal, zygomatic, brachial, parotid, uterine, tibial and foot. The largest volume of cyst fluid was 71. There was one intraoperative death and one postoperative death recorded. Endocystectomy +/- a scolicidal was the commonest procedure performed. However, 165 percutaneous aspiration injection of a scolicidal agent and reaspiration procedures were performed, six being on pregnant women. This is one of the largest series of surgical hydatid patients from Africa and demonstrates the wide diversity in cyst location. (C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins."

The parasite detected is Leishmania infantum and the main reservoir is the dog. Competent vectors to transmit the parasite are sandflies, of which there are two species distributed throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. This article reviews the current situation and the behaviour of leishmaniasis in Spain. It analyzes and compares information about the disease from hospital discharges and from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network. It also analyses the risk factors that facilitate transmission identified in previous studies. Since 2009 an outbreak is occurring in the southwest part of the Community of Madrid, with a significant number of cases, about 400 and the detection of a new reservoir, the hare. The conditions that can increase the incidence of leishmaniasis are linked to the increase number of infected vectors, increase sandfly density, increase hosts or the appearance of new reservoirs in a geographic area. This infection has got a complex transmission dynamic. To timely respond to outbreaks a comprehensive and multisectoral action plan should be developed joined by all the institutions involved in the preparation and response. Before an outbreak occurs, it is important to study all the factors affecting the transmission in that place and to adapt the action plan to the specific characteristics."

It is a zoonosis that represents a significant concern for the food industry due to the high mortality rate it causes and the fact that the organism is capable of growing at refrigeration temperatures. Dairy products and ready-to-eat meats are among the foods most often involved in listeriosis outbreaks. Listeria is a common contaminant in the dairy environment, both on the farm and in the processing plant. The main sources of L. monocytogenes in dairy farms are manure and improperly fermented silage. If silage crops are grown on contaminated land, a new cycle of silage contamination and faecal shedding by ruminants that consume such silage may ensue. High loads of L. monocytogenes produced in farm environments may thus represent a primary source for the introduction of this pathogen into the human food supply chain; dairy cows would represent a reservoir for the bacterium, and raw milk and beef would represent the main vehicles for its transmission from dairy farms to humans. Even if contamination originates in post-processing environments, contaminated raw foods may still represent a vehicle for introducing L. monocytogenes into food processing plants. Molecular typing methods have confirmed that common strains of L. monocytogenes are present in dairy farm-associated isolates and isolates from both human epidemic and sporadic cases. Pre-harvest (on-farm) control of listeriosis should be based mainly on the control of manure, silage, herd health and milking practices."

It has been noted not only in tropical areas, such as West Africa where it is most endemic, but also in moderate non-tropical climate areas, including Australia and Japan. Clinical presentation starts with a papule, nodule, plaque or edematous form which eventually leads to extensive skin ulceration. It can affect all age groups, but especially children aged between 5 and 15years in West Africa. Multiple-antibiotic treatment has proven effective, and with surgical intervention at times of severity, it is curable. However, if diagnosis and treatment is delayed, those affected may be left with life-long disabilities. The disease is not yet fully understood, including its route of transmission and pathogenesis. However, due to recent research, several important features of the disease are now being elucidated. Notably, there may be undiagnosed cases in other parts of the world where BU has not yet been reported. Japan exemplifies the finding that awareness among dermatologists plays a key role in BU case detection. So, what about in other countries where a case of BU has never been diagnosed and there is no awareness of the disease among the population or, more importantly, among health professionals?

Besides in animals, the infection can also be a significant diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic problem in human medicine. The aim of the paper is to present the zoonotic aspect of rhodococcosis, including basic data about pathogen, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture, pathology, diagnosis and therapy of the disease. R. equi was isolated for the first time in 1923 by Magnusson in Sweden from a dead foal with the signs of pyogranulomatous pneumonia. The first case of human R. equi infection has been described in 1967 in a 29-year-old man subjected to immunosuppressive therapy. Hundreds of new cases of human rhodococcosis have been described since that time all over the world. The majority of human cases of R. equi infections concern patients immunodeppressed during the course of different diseases or treated with immunosuppressive drugs. However, 10-15% of cases concern fully immunocompetent patients. The role of farm animals as a primary source of infection to people has not been proved, but the importance of a contaminated environment seems to be evident. Molecular studies of human R. equi strains revealed that only 21% of isolates contained the typical for foal strains VapA plasmid. This suggests that the pathogenesis of the disease in humans may be different from that described in animals. Immunological investigations supporting the role of cell-mediated immunity in R. equi infections explain why AIDS patients with confirmed CD4(+) lymphocytes deficiency and decreasing ability of INF gamma synthesis are more susceptible to infection in comparison to immunocompetent people. The clinical course of rhodococcosis in humans is varied, but in 80% of cases the process is localized in the respiratory tract. The mortality rate in immunosuppressed patients ranges between 20-55%. Diagnosis of rhodococcosis in humans is based on the isolation and identification of the pathogen in antemortem collected biological material. Radiology and CT may also be helpful. Myc. tuberculosis and Nocardia spp. infections should be included as a differential diagnosis. Treatment of rhodococcosis in humans, similarly to animals, usually requires a several-week course of a combination of 2-3 antibiotics. In practice intravenous application of vancomycin, carbapenem or aminoglycosides combined with oral administration of azithromycin and/or rifampin is used. In apparently cured individuals relapses occur frequently in which pathological changes are localized in primarily involved or in other tissues and organs."

High rates of abortion among infected ruminants and hemorrhagic fever in infected humans are major public health concerns. Commercially available veterinary RVF vaccines are important for preventing the spread of the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in endemic countries; however, RVFV outbreaks continue to occur frequently in endemic countries in the 21st century. In the U.S., the live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine has been developed for both animal and human vaccination. This vaccine strain is well attenuated, and a single dose induces neutralizing antibodies in both ruminants and humans.Areas covered: This review describes scientific evidences of MP-12 vaccine efficacy and safety, as well as MP-12 variants recently developed by reverse genetics, in comparison with other RVF vaccines.Expert commentary: The containment of active RVF outbreaks and long-term protection from RVF exposure to infected mosquitoes are important goals for RVF vaccination. MP-12 vaccine will allow immediate vaccination of susceptible animals in case of an unexpected RVF outbreak in the U.S., whereas MP-12 vaccine may be also useful for the RVF control in endemic regions."

The case fatality rate of Ebola in HCPs has been reported up to 73%. The WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS were developed in 2004 and used as a template for other emerging diseases preparedness. Risks to HCPs with emerging diseases are related to inappropriate and insufficient infection control measures during an initial encounter, at the beginning of outbreak and with an overwhelming number of patient cases. To date, there are no reports of avian influenza transmission to HCPs from affected cases.

Reduction or elimination of these pathogens in the first part of the food chain (on the farm) is important to prevent disease among consumers of animal products. In organic farming, elimination becomes more difficult, as food animals are allowed outdoors and have easy access to potential sources of hazardous pathogens. Whilst rodents are often associated by organic farmers with infrastructural damage and eating or spoiling of stored feed and products, their zoonotic risks are frequently underestimated. They can amplify the number of pathogens in the environment and transfer them to food animals. Thus organic farmers should be aware of the need for rodent control from a food safety perspective. Preferably, rodent control should form an integral part of a total package of hygiene measures to prevent transfer of food-borne pathogens. These should also include e.g. control of wild birds and flies and obligatory disinfection of boots/clothes and equipment for farm workers and visitors. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry."

Nonetheless, they have attracted a strong interest from the point of view of conservation biology because many populations have been close to extinction and because of their recognised role in ecosystems as top predators and scavengers and as flagship species. Today, after more than a century of persecution, and with the exception of some vultures still very much affected by illegal poisoning, many populations of birds of prey have experienced significant recoveries in many regions of Spain and the European Mediterranean. These changes pose new challenges when addressing the conservation of raptors in the coming decades. On this basis, and from a preferentially Mediterranean perspective, we have focused our attention on the need of describing and quantifying the role of these birds as providers of both regulating (rodent pest control and removal of livestock carcasses) and cultural ecosystem services. Moreover, we revisited persisting conflicts with human interests (predation of game species) and call attention to the emergence of new conflicts with a strong social and media component such as the predation on live cattle by vultures. Also, the rampant humanization of the environment determines the need for new solutions to the growing, yet scarcely explored, problem of accidents in new infrastructures such as mortality in wind farms. Finally, we explored in depth the ecological response of birds of prey to large-scale habitat changes such as urbanisation and abandonment of marginal lands that are also expected to increase in the near future.

One among those infectious diseases agents is rotavirus (RV), which is the foremost cause of gastrointestinal infections in mammalian and avian species all over the world, also a predominant cause of enteric infections in pigs, and has potential public health concerns. This review provides information on the frequency of RV infection, genotype diversity and zoonotic potential of its emerging reassortants in Indian porcine population. Prevalence studies done so far revealed gruesomely higher porcine RV prevalence in north-eastern region (46.4%) of India. Analysis of available sequence data of VP7 gene (G genotype) and VP4 gene (P genotype) of porcine group A rotaviruses (Po-RVAs) showed the presence of G4, G6, 09, 012 and P[6], P[7], P[13]and P[19] genotypes. Lately, few of the porcine RV strains also exhibited unique genomic constellations with evidence of interspecies transmission events, mainly involving RV strains of human origin. Evolution of rotaviruses is fast due to point mutation and reassortants generation in case of multiple infections. Thus it is imperative to generate the baseline information for formulating better disease preventive and control strategy. At present, nationwide surveillance and monitoring is prerequisite to assess the distribution of common and unusual genotypes of RVs circulating among pig population in India."

It is the single most important cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. Rotavirus gastroenteritis is associated with high morbidity in developed countries and significant mortality in developing countries. In children aged less than 5 years, they are the most frequent agent of severe acute diarrheal illnesses. Typically, symptomatic rotavirus diseases in infants (<5 years) and the elderly (>70 years) arise with sudden onset of watery diarrhoea with high risk of dehydration, accompanied by vomiting. Fecal-oral transmission is the most likely route of virus spread. Group A serotype strains G1 through G4 account for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, with G1 being the predominant serotype. The virus preferentially infects the mature small-intestinal enterocytes. Treatment of rotavirus diarrhoea is usually symptomatic and comprises a sufficient fluid and electrolyte substitution. Although nitazoxanide and some other drugs show high efficacy against rotavirus in vitro and in vivo, there is currently no recommended specific antiviral therapy. In India, two efficient and secure live vaccines against rotaviruses have been approved. Rotarix (GSK) vaccine is derived from single attenuated human rotavirus G1P[8], whereas RotaTeq (Merck) is a pentavalent mixture of naturally attenuated bovine/human rotavirus reassortants. Though these vaccines have already dramatically decreased the morbidity associated with rotavirus in countries where they are widely used, the third generation of vaccines, based on inactivated viruses or recombinant virus like particles are already in pipeline.

Rotavirus infections have a worldwide prevalence. The viral genome is composed of 11 double-stranded RNA segments with six structural and five or six non-structural proteins. Over 35,000 strains have been identified and classified into five main (A, B, C, D, E) and three additional tentative (F, G, H) serotype groups. A binary classification system has been proposed defining 'G' or '13' types, with at least 27 G and 35 P genotypes reported thusfar. The virus is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral and oral routes. After attachment, entry into the host cells occurs through direct entry, fusion or endocytosis. Main mechanisms of Rotavirus-induced diarrhoea involve extensive enterocyte losses and nutrient disdigestion and malabsorption. Clinical features of Rotavirus infections range from asymptomatic infections to fulminant disease leading to rapid death. In calves, lambs and kids, piglets and foals, salient sign of the disease is diarrhoea; diarrhoeic faeces are white, yellow or, in severe cases, blood-tinted or frank haemorrhagic. In dogs and cats, the infection occurs usually as self-limiting diarrhoea. Avian Rotavirus infections are characterized by enteritis, growth depression and/or growth retardation. Definitive diagnosis of the infection can only be achieved by laboratory tests, including electron microscopic examination, immunohistochemical examination, immunofluorescence, ELISA, latex agglutination and molecular techniques. There is no specific treatment against Rotavirus infections. Treatment is based in providing supportive care and managing clinical signs and potential complications. Effective vaccines, containing inactivated, recombinant or attenuated strains of the virus, are available. Challenge studies have shown the ease of the virus in cross-infecting various animal species; animal strains of the virus may cross species and infect humans. Due to the ability of the virus to overcome species barriers, animal strains may act as natural source of viral genomes, promoting mutations and creating new viral genotypes, whose virulence cannot be predictable."

One of the priorities in conducting research on highly pathogenic microorganisms is to protect the environment from their spread. Many currently emerging diseases are zoonotic diseases, which can easily spread in the environment and are dangerous to both animals and humans. In order to eliminate the possibility of releasing pathogens from laboratories and experimental animal houses, a classification and technical requirements have been introduced to enable a safe conduct of research. There are four levels of biological safety, known as Biological Safety Levels (BSL). At level 1, non-pathogenic microorganisms are used for research, which is conducted at open tables. Pathogens dealt with at level II are transmitted by blood and body fluids; infection may occur by contact with conjunctivas or through a breach in the skin surface. At this level, any contact of tested material with conjunctivas must be avoided, sharp objects must be secured, and sterile equipment must be used. Level 111 applies to airborne germs. Research is carried out in a laminar flow cabinet. To prevent transmission of microorganisms from the laboratory area, underpressure must be maintained with a proper ventilation system, and a number of control systems are required. Level IV applies to the most pathogenic microorganisms causing diseases of high mortality. Required protection measures include, among other things, a proper ventilation system, sluices with disinfectant shower; and protective wear ensuring a complete isolation of the personnel from the environment and maintaining internal overpressure in relation to the laboratory environment. The above 4 levels of biological safety also apply to animals, and then the levels are known as ACL. This publication discusses the following systems: ventilation, electricity generation and maintenance, inactivation of contaminated sewage, communication between ""clean"" and ""dirty"" areas, waste disposal, decontamination of rooms and equipment, BMS surveillance and procedures."

Among the different diseases occurring in poultry, those caused by the genus Salmonella is the most common, causing serious losses to the poultry industry in terms of mortality, reduced growth and loss of egg production. The diseases caused by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium have got public health significance, as well as being associated with food poisoning in humans. Salmonellosis in humans is mainly caused by S. typhimurium. The ability of this serovar to infect birds and contaminate eggs makes it a potent infection agent for humans.

Propagation of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium has increased since the second half of the twentieth century, derived from two changes in the epidemiology of salmonellosis that occurred worldwide: the emergence of human infections caused by Salmonella Enteritidis, and the multiple resistances against antibiotics of Salmonella Typhimurium strains. Most retrospective studies suggest an epidemiological relationship between human infections and poultry products. Modernization of poultry industry and exportation of progenitor stock birds have played an important roll disseminating Salmonella Enteritidis. Campylobacteriosis is the most frequent enteric bacterial diseases in developed countries. Campylobacter jejuni is the most frequent cause of acute infectious diarrheas, and the sources of infection are mainly poultry products. The present review includes relevant taxonomic and pathogenic aspects of these organisms; and stresses the problematic of diagnosis and detection, analyzing techniques that permit rapid detection of animal carriers. Finally, some preliminary findings, not yet published, suggest that a prevalence of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis in Mexican poultry farms must be similar to that found in other countries with massive poultry production; therefore, epidemiological studies to determine the frequency of human infections, derived from poultry consumption, are recommended."

Currently, at a global level, the main sources of infection for humans include meat products, including the consumption of contaminated poultry meat, in spite of the success of Salmonella control measures implemented in food-animal production of industrialized countries. In recent years, a shift in Salmonella serotypes related to poultry and poultry production has been reported in diverse geographical regions, being particularly associated with the spread of certain well -adapted clones. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance in non-typhoidal Salmonella is considered one of the major public health threats related with food-animal production, including the poultry production chain and poultry meat, which is an additional concern in the management of salmonellosis. The circulation of the same multidrug-resistant Salmonella clones and/or identical mobile genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance genes from poultry to humans highlights this scenario. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the role of poultry meat on salmonellosis at a global scale and the main problems that could hinder the success of Salmonella control measures at animal production level. With the increasing globalization of foodstuffs like poultry meat, new problems and challenges might arise regarding salmonellosis control, making new integrated intervention strategies necessary along the food chain.

The SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that it is no longer the exclusive privilege of countries to report and respond to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories, but that the global community has also assumed this role, aided by the ease and power of electronic communication through the World Wide Web. This phenomenon has been cited by some scholars as a potential infringement on national sovereignty that compromises the concept that states reign supreme over their territories and peoples. At the same time, however, countries are increasingly seeking to collaborate internationally in infectious disease surveillance and response, as shown in the current situation of avian influenza (H5N1), and in the formal agreement leading to the revised International Health Regulations (IHR), suggesting that a new world order prevails over issues that once had been considered the sole domain of a sovereign nation."

Much of the recent research geared toward understanding mechanisms underlying rickettsial pathogenicity has centered on characterization of secreted proteins that directly engage eukaryotic cells. Herein, we review all aspects of the Rickettsia secretome, including six secretion systems, 19 characterized secretory proteins, and potential moonlighting proteins identified on surfaces of multiple Rickettsia species. Employing bioinformatics and phylogenomics, we present novel structural and functional insight on each secretion system.

Furthermore, for most secretion pathways, the requisite signal sequences mediating translocation are poorly understood.

Methods All relevant articles were searched in the electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database, Chinese Wanfang database) up to November 2016. The pooled seroprevalence and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by random-or fixed-model on the basis of heterogeneity. Results In total, 21 studies containing 23,848 blood samples from 7 provinces were included in this meta-analysis. The minimum and maximum reported seroprevalences of SFTSV among humans in China were 0.23% and 9.17%, respectively. The overall pooled seroprevalence of SFTSV antibodies was 4.3% (95% CI: 3.2%-5.5%).

The disease has a high propensity to spread to household members and healthcare workers and may be associated with transmission and outbreaks in the community. Severe illness in immunocompromised patients, sophisticated hospital facilities and treatment procedures, particularly those that generate aerosols, and lack of adequate isolation and control measures, can amplify transmission and contribute to so-called super-spreading events. The presence of non-specific clinical manifestations at presentation and a lack of validated early diagnostic methods and effective management pose great difficulty for frontline physicians in the containment of this disease. The mortality of SARS is in the region of 10 to 15%; the presence of underlying disease, high initial C-reactive protein levels, and positive SARS-CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples are associated with a higher risk of respiratory failure and mortality. Despite the disappearance of SARS cases worldwide, the potential evolution of SARS-CoV in animals suggests the disease may re-emerge in the future. Heightened levels of clinical suspicion, rapid case detection and isolation, and contact tracing are essential to effective management of future outbreaks.

Common laboratory features include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, raised alanine transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The constellation of compatible clinical and laboratory findings, together with certain characteristic radiological features and lack of clinical response to broad spectrum antibiotics, should arouse suspicion of SARS.

The discovery of this virus was soon followed by the discovery of the civet and bat SARS-CoV and the human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Surveillance of coronaviruses in many animal species has increased the number on the list of coronaviruses to at least 36 The explosive nature of the first SARS epidemic, the high mortality, its transient reemergence a year later, and economic disruptions led to a rush on research of the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the virus and the disease. This research resulted in over 4, 000 publications, only some of the most representative works of which could be reviewed in this article. The marked increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development of diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, vaccines, and epidemiological and infection control measures, which could prove to be useful in randomized control trials if SARS should return. The findings that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like virus and that civets are the amplification host highlight the importance of wildlife and biosecurity in farms and wet markets, which can serve as the source and amplification centers for emerging infections."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program, Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), Shigella was the third most reported foodborne bacterial pathogen in 2002. Foods are most commonly contaminated with Shigella by an infected food handler who practices poor personal hygiene. Shigella is acid resistant, salt tolerant, and can survive at infective levels in many types of foods such as fruits and vegetables, low pH foods, prepared foods, and foods held in modified atmosphere or vacuum packaging. Survival is often increased when food is held at refrigerated temperatures. Detection methods for Shigella include conventional culture methods, immunological methods, and molecular microbiological methods. Conventional culture of Shigella in foods is often problematic due to the lack of appropriate selective media. Immunological methods for Shigella have been researched, yet there is only one commercially available test kit. Molecular microbiological methods such as PCR, oligonucleotide microarrays, and rep-PCR have also been developed for the detection and identification of Shigella.

Using mycobacterial diseases as an example, we discuss herein the pros and cons of the current Spanish Wildlife Disease Surveillance Scheme providing suggestions for monitoring relevant diseases shared with wildlife in other regions facing similar challenges. Six points should be considered. This includes: (1) making sure the disease is properly monitored in the relevant domestic animals or even in humans; (2) also making sure that background information on wildlife population ecology is available to maximize the benefits of the monitoring effort; (3) selecting the appropriate wildlife hosts for monitoring, while being flexible enough to incorporate new ones if research suggests their participation; (4) selecting the appropriate methods for diagnosis and for time and space trend analysis; (5) deciding which parameters to target for monitoring; and finally (6) establishing a reasonable sampling effort and a suitable sampling stratification to ensure detecting changes over time and changes in response to management actions. Wildlife disease monitoring produces knowledge that benefits at least three different agencies, namely, animal health, public health and conservation, and these should combine efforts and resources. Setting up stable, comprehensive and accurate schemes at different spatial scales should become a priority. Resources are always a limiting factor, but experience shows that combined, cross-collaborative efforts allow establishing acceptable schemes with a low enough cost to be sustainable over time. These six steps for monitoring relevant shared diseases can be adapted to many other geographical settings and different disease situations."
4294,Joy,NO,NA,"Devaux, CA",small oversights that led to the great plague of marseille (1720-1723): lessons from the past,2013,INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Web of Science,"In recent decades, the issue of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases has become an increasingly important area of concern in public health. Today, like centuries ago, infectious diseases confront us with the fear of death and have heavily influenced social behaviors and policy decisions at local, national and international levels. Remarkably, an infectious disease such as plague, which is disseminated from one country to another mainly by commercial transportation, remains today, as it was in the distant past, a threat for human societies. Throughout history, plague outbreaks prevailed on numerous occasions in Mediterranean harbors, including Marseille in the south of France. A few months ago, the municipal authorities of the city of Marseille, announced the archaeological discovery of the last remnants of a ""lazaretto"" or ""lazaret"" (http://20.minutes.fr, March 3th, 2012), a place equipped with an infirmary and destined to isolate ship passengers quarantined for health reasons. More recently, on September 16th, 2012, the anchor of the ship ""Grand Saint Antoine"" responsible for bringing the plague to Marseille in 1720, was recovered and it will be restored before being presented to the public in 2013 (http://www.libemarseille.fr/henry/2012/09/lancre-du-bateau-qui-amena-la-grande-peste-%C3%A0-marseille.html). In the light of these recent archaeological discoveries, it is quite instructive to revisit the sequence of events and decisions that led to the outbreak of the Great Plague of Marseille between 1720 and 1723. It comes to the evidence that although the threat was known and health surveillance existed with quite effective preventive measures such as quarantine, the accumulation of small negligence led to one of the worst epidemics in the city (about 30% of casualties among the inhabitants). This is an excellent model to illustrate the issues we are facing with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases today and to define how to improve biosurveillance and response tomorrow. Importantly, the risk of plague dissemination by transport trade is negligible between developed countries, however, this risk still persists in developing countries. In addition, the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of Yersinia pestis, the infectious agent of plague, is raising serious concerns for public health. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Measures against the increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria are discussed, and difficulties due to the complexity of this problem are enumerated. It is recommended that the application of antibiotics in veterinary medicine be minimized and that thay be replaced by vaccines, whenever possible. It is also noted that the participation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria of strictly human origin in causing infections in humans is higher than that of antibiotic-resistant bacteria originating from animals. These bacteria also cause more difficulties in antibiotic therapy of human bacterial diseases. According to the American Academy of Microbiology, cited in the paper, factors that determine the development and spread of the antibiotic resistance of bacteria are complex, multifactorial and largely unknown. Therefore, further research is necessary."

We identified 173 new variants from 91 species, of which 73 species had not been previously described in pigs. These new species, of which one third was zoonotic, were taxonomically diverse. They were identified throughout the study period, predominantly in the main pork producing countries, with the rate of discovery of new virus variants doubling within the last 10 years of the study period. Whilst infectious agent species newly detected in high-income countries were more likely to be associated with higher virulence, zoonotic agents prevailed in low- and middle-income countries. Although this trend is influenced by factors conditioning infectious agent detection - diagnostic methods, surveillance efforts, research interests -, it may suggest that different scales and types of production systems promote emergence of certain types of infectious agents. Considering the rapid transformation of the swine industry, concerted efforts are needed for improving our understanding of the factors influencing the emergence of infectious agents. This information then needs to inform the design of risk-based surveillance systems and strategies directly mitigating the risk associated with these factors."

Disease is a natural part of all ecosystems; however, in some cases, a shift in the balance between the host, pathogen, and the environment may lead to epizootics in natural or cultured populations. In marine systems, host-microbe interactions are less understood than their terrestrial counterparts.

Our objective was to review all published literature about the spillover effects of interventions on health outcomes in low-middle income countries and to identify methods used in estimating these effects. Methods: We searched 19 electronic databases for articles published before 2014 and hand-searched titles from 2010 to 2013 in five relevant journals. We adapted the Cochrane Collaboration's quality grading tool for spillover estimation and rated the quality of evidence. Results: A total of 54 studies met inclusion criteria. We found a wide range of terminology used to describe spillovers, a lack of standardization among spillover methods and poor reporting of spillovers in many studies. We identified three primary mechanisms of spillovers: reduced disease transmission, social proximity and substitution of resources within households. We found the strongest evidence for spillovers through reduced disease transmission, particularly vaccines and mass drug administration. In general, the proportion of a population receiving an intervention was associated with improved health. Most studies were of moderate or low quality. We found evidence of publication bias for certain spillover estimates but not for total or direct effects. To facilitate improved reporting and standardization in future studies, we developed a reporting checklist adapted from the CONSORT framework specific to reporting spillover effects.

There are only 16 cases in the literature that have described S. intermedius as a cause of infection in humans. Most of these cases have been described in association with exposure to animals, mostly dogs. However, this pathogen can cause infection in healthy individuals even without exposure to animals. Methods: All previous cases of S. intermedius infection included in our literature review were found using a PubMed search (1960-November 2009) of the English-language medical literature applying the terms 'Staphylococcus intermedius', 'abscess', 'infection', 'humans'. The references cited in these articles were examined to identify additional reports. Results: We describe the first case of skin abscesses caused by S. intermedius in an immunocompetent patient who used intravenous cocaine after coating his syringes with his saliva. We also summarize the literature regarding infections caused by S. intermedius in humans. Conclusions: This case illustrates for the first time that S. intermedius can cause skin abscesses in humans after direct inoculation of this pathogen into the skin and soft tissues. Clinicians should be aware of the fact that although the vast majority of infections from coagulase-positive Staphylococcus infections are secondary to Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius is also a potential pathogen in humans.

Emerging infections since HIV have had different transmission pathways and challenged blood programs to draw upon resources for a rapid and effective response, with recognition that the original focus on sexual/drug-related risk of HIV and hepatitis was inadequate. The focus of surveillance programs on new and emerging pathogens fulfills a key role in risk assessment and policy formulation. The precise nature of such activities varies by country because of the structure of the blood programs and surveillance systems, the strategic focus of the blood programs, and the epidemiology of disease in each country.

The majority of outbreaks were wildlife zoonotic, and vector-borne diseases, such as brucellosis, leptospirosis, listeriosis, tularemia, Q-fever, Lyme disease, anthrax, rabies, viral hemorrhagic fevers, sandfly fever, tick-borne encephalitis and leishmainiasis. Epidemiological factors determined by ecology of causative agents are often the most useful diagnostic clues. The recognition of evolving problems of emerging and re-emerging diseases emphasizes the need for the development of better laboratory diagnostic methods for the surveillance and tracking of the diseases, and for continued research of factors contributing to the transmission of the organisms. The continuous occurrence of previously unidentified infections requires prospective national strategies for timely recognition of the syndromes, causative agent identification, establishment of criteria and methods for the diagnosis, optimization of the treatment regime, and determination of successful approaches to prevention and control. Wildlife diseases surveillance in the most of the Balkan countries has been coordinated by the WHO since 1992. Although new technology and communication have extremely improved in the last decade, there is a need for optimal communication lines among the Balkan countries, better exploitation of communication technologies like the Internet and other media in the field of emerging diseases."

Social and demographic changes possibly related to this phenomenon include a rapid population growth, the increase in urban migration and movement across international borders by tourists and immigrants, alterations in the habitats of animals and arthropods that transmit disease, as well as the raise of patients with impaired host defense abilities. Continuous surveillance programs of emergent pathogens and antimicrobial resistance are warranted for detecting in real time new pathogens, as well as to characterize molecular mechanisms of resistance. In order to become more effective, surveillance programs of emergent pathogens should be organized as a multicenter laboratory network connected to the main public and private infection control centers. Microbiological data should be integrated to guide therapy, adapting therapy to local ecology and resistance patterns.

Swine HEV infection in pigs generally occurs at about 2-3 months of age, and about 80%-100% of the pigs in commercial farms in the USA were infected. Swine HEV infections have now been recognized in pigs in many other countries of the world. Interspecies transmission has been documented, as swine HEV infects nonhuman primates and some strains of human HEV infect pigs. Recent seroepidemiological. studies showed that swine veterinarians and other pig handlers are at higher risk of HEV infection compared to normal blood donors. In addition, novel strains of human HEV recovered from hepatitis patients in the USA, Japan and Taiwan are genetically more closely related to strains of swine HEV from respective countries than to other strains of human HEV. The ubiquitous nature of the virus in pigs and the demonstrated ability of cross-species infection raise a potential concern for swine HEV infection in xenotransplantation with pig organs. This chapter discusses the recent advances in HEV research with emphases on potential zoonosis and xenozoonosis."

In this review. the epidemiology of swine influenza virus (SIV) infection in North American pigs is described in detail. The first 80 years of SI remained relatively static, whereas the last decade has become dynamic with the establishment of many emerging subtypes. With the increasing number of novel subtypes and genetic variants, the control of SI has become increasingly difficult and innovative strategies to combat this economically important zoonotic disease are critical. Therefore, protective immune responses against influenza virus infections as well as new paradigms of vaccine development in pigs are discussed in the review.

To better understand the role of these receptors in regulating pallidal functions, we compared their subcellular and subsynaptic localization in the external and internal segments of the globus pallidus (GPe and GPi) in monkeys, using pre- and post-embedding immunocytochemistry with antibodies against GABA-A (alpha 1, beta 2/3 subunits) and GABA-BR1 receptor subtype. Our results demonstrate that GABA-A and GABA-B receptors display a differential pattern of subcellular and subsynaptic localization in both segments of the globus pallidus. The majority of GABA-BR1 immunolabeling is intracellular, whereas immunoreactivity for GABA-A receptor subunits is mostly bound to the plasma membrane. A significant proportion of both GABA-BR1 and GABA-A receptor immunolabeling is extrasynaptic, but GABA-A receptor subunits also aggregate in the main body of putative GABAergic symmetric synapses established by striatal- and pallidal-like terminals. GABA-BR1 immunoreactivity is expressed presynaptically in putative glutamatergic terminals, while GABA-A alpha 1 and beta 2/3 receptor subunits are exclusively post-synaptic and often coexist at individual symmetric synapses in both GPe and GPi. In conclusion, our findings corroborate the concept that ionotropic and metabotropic GABA receptors are located to subserve different effects in pallidal neurons. Although the aggregation of GABA-A receptors at symmetric synapses is consistent with their role in fast inhibitory synaptic transmission, the extrasynaptic distribution of both GABA-A and GABA-B receptors provides a substrate for complex modulatory functions that rely predominantly on the spillover of GABA.

Although syphilis is still endemic in many developing countries, it has re-emerged in several developed countries. The resurgence of syphilis is a major concern to global public health, particularly since the lesions of early syphilis increase the risk of acquisition and transmission of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because there is no vaccine to prevent syphilis, control is mainly dependent on the identification and treatment of infected individuals and their contacts with penicillin G, the first-line drug for all stages of syphilis. The emergence of clinically significant azithromycin resistance in Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the syphilis agent, has resulted in treatment failures, thus precluding the routine use of this second-line drug.

Purpose: To critically evaluate the potential utility of existing surveillance systems for illnesses and syndromes related to bioterrorism. Data Sources: Databases of peer-reviewed articles (for example, MEDLINE for articles published from January 1985 to April 2002) and Web sites of relevant government and nongovernment agencies. Study Selection: Reports that described or evaluated systems for collecting, analyzing, or presenting surveillance data for bioterrorism-related illnesses or syndromes. Data Extraction: From each included article, the authors abstracted information about the type of surveillance data collected; method of collection, analysis, and presentation of surveillance data; and outcomes of evaluations of the system. Data Synthesis: 17 510 article citations and 8088 government and nongovernmental Web sites were reviewed. From these, the authors included 115 systems that collect various surveillance reports, including 9 syndromic surveillance systems, 20 systems collecting bioterrorism detector data, 13 systems collecting influenza-related data, and 23 systems collecting laboratory and antimicrobial resistance data. Only the systems collecting syndromic surveillance data and detection system data were designed, at least in part, for bioterrorism preparedness applications. Syndromic surveillance systems have been deployed for both event-based and continuous bioterrorism surveillance. Few surveillance systems have been comprehensively evaluated. Only 3 systems have had both sensitivity and specificity evaluated. Limitations: Data from some existing surveillance systems (particularly those developed by the military) may not be publicly available. Conclusions: Few surveillance systems have been specifically designed for collecting and analyzing data for the early detection of a bioterrorist event. Because current evaluations of surveillance systems for detecting bioterrorism and emerging infections are insufficient to characterize the timeliness or sensitivity and specificity, clinical and public health decision making based on these systems may be compromised."

They occurred in a nonendemic region and were selected on the basis of initial clinical presentation suggesting systemic immune disease. C. burnetii was detected using indirect immunofluorescence serology. Results: Q fever was acute in 4 of the 7 patients and chronic in 3. None had endocarditis. The initial presentations suggested Crohn's disease, Goodpasture's syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, adult-onset Still's disease, polyarteritis nodosa, giant-cell arteritis, and essential type II cryoglobulinemia. Two patients had antiphospholipid antibodies, 1 had transient IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy, and 1 had polyclonal T CD8+ large granular lymphocyte expansion.

It is a major food-borne zoonosis, which is an economic constraint to the pig industry as well as a serious medical problem. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is regarded as the most frequent parasitosis of the central nervous system (CNS) and the most common cause of epilepsy in India. The commonest lesions are presented as granuloma. Unhealthy pig-rearing practices, lack of sanitation, inadequate meat inspection, rural-to-urban migration and other factors have contributed to the endemic status of the disease in India. At the same time, increasing number of detections consequent to improved serological and imaging techniques have aided definitive diagnosis, increasingly incriminating NCC as the cause of considerable morbidity and mortality with resultant socio-economic burden. While there are sporadic reports on pigs, largely based on prevalence at postmortem or serological, considerable epidemiological, diagnostic and clinical data has come up on human side in recent years. In the spectra of clinical manifestations, ocular disease and disseminated cysticercosis are being reported with increasing frequency. Detection and anthelmintic treatment of human taeniasis is the main component of a control strategy. Porcine cysticercosis should also receive due attention, and development of an onchosphere antigen-based vaccine is a promising line.

Understanding the epidemiology of human cysticercosis (HCC) in endemic regions will help to expose critical information about the transmission of the disease, which could be used to design efficient control programs. This review gathered serological data on apparent prevalence of T. solium circulating antigens and/or seroprevalence of T. solium antibodies, apparent prevalence of human taeniasis and risk factors for HCC from endemic communities in order to understand the differences in exposure to the parasite and active infections with T. solium metacestodes in endemic areas around the world. Methods Three databases were used to search sero-epidemiological data from community-based studies conducted between 1989 and 2014 in cysticercosis endemic communities worldwide. The search focused on data obtained from T. solium circulating antigen detection by monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA and/or T. solium antibody seroprevalence determined by Enzyme-linked Immunoelectrotransfer Blot (EITB). A meta-analysis was performed per continent. Principal Findings A total of 39,271 participants from 19 countries, described in 37 articles were studied. The estimates for the prevalence of circulating T. solium antigens for Africa, Latin America and Asia were: 7.30%(95% CI [4.23-12.31]), 4.08% (95% CI [2.77-5.95]) and 3.98% (95% CI [2.81-5.61]), respectively.

Recent insights from disease ecology have helped transform our understanding of infectious disease dynamics and yielded new strategies to better manage wildlife diseases. Simultaneously, wildlife disease management (WDM) presents opportunities for large-scale empirical tests of disease ecology theory in diverse natural systems. To assess whether the potential complementarity between WDM and disease ecology theory has been realized, we evaluate the extent to which specific concepts in disease ecology theory have been explicitly applied in peer-reviewed WDM literature. While only half of WDM articles published in the past decade incorporated disease ecology theory, theory has been incorporated with increasing frequency over the past 40years. Contrary to expectations, articles authored by academics were no more likely to apply disease ecology theory, but articles that explain unsuccessful management often do so in terms of theory.

However, recent data indicate that some of these infections, especially when diagnosed solely on the basis of morphology, have been identified with this causative agent incorrectly, confusing other Diphyllobothrium species with D. latum. Another widely distributed species, D. dendriticum, has never been considered as a frequent parasite of man, even though it is found commonly throughout arctic and subarctic regions parasitizing piscivorous birds and mammals. Recent cases of Europeans infected with this cestode called into question the actual geographic distribution of this tapeworm, largely ignored by medical parasitologists. Methodology and Results On the basis of revision of more than 900 available references and a description and revision of recent European human cases using morphological and molecular (cox1) data supplemented by newly characterized D. dendriticum sequences, we updated the current knowledge of the life-cycle, geographic distribution, epidemiological status, and molecular diagnostics of this emerging causal agent of zoonotic disease of man. Conclusions The tapeworm D. dendriticum represents an example of a previously neglected, probably underdiagnosed parasite of man with a potential to spread globally. Recent cases of diphyllobothriosis caused by D. dendriticum in Europe (Netherlands, Switzerland and Czech Republic), where the parasite has not been reported previously, point out that causative agents of diphyllobothriosis and other zoonoses can be imported throughout the world. Molecular tools should be used for specific and reliable parasite diagnostics, and also rare or non-native species should be considered. This will considerably help improve our knowledge of the distribution and epidemiology of these human parasites."

The neurohumoral system affects several organs and currently our knowledge of the molecular and systemic pathways involved in the neurohumoral activation is incomplete. All the methods of assessing the degree of activation of the autonomic system have limitations and they are not interchangeable. The methods considered include noradrenaline spillover, microneurography, radiotracer imaging and analysis of heart rate and blood pressure (heart rate variability, baroreceptor sensitivity, heart rate turbulence). Despite the difficulties, medications that affect the ANS have been shown to improve mortality in heart failure and the mechanism is related to attenuation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. However, limitations of compliance with medication, side effects and inadequate SNS attenuation are issues of concern with the pharmacological approach. The newer device based therapies for sympathetic modulation are showing encouraging results. As they directly influence the autonomic nervous system, more mechanistic information can be gleaned if appropriate investigations are performed at the time of the outcome trials. However, clinicians should be reminded that the ANS is an evolutionary survival mechanism and therefore there is a need to proceed with caution when trying to completely attenuate its effects. So our enthusiasm for the application of these devices in heart failure should be controlled, especially as none of the devices have trial data powered to assess effects on mortality or cardiovascular events.

First published November 25, 2009; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00832.2009.-Sympathetic nervous system responses typically are regionally differentiated, with activation in one outflow sometimes accompanying no change or sympathetic inhibition in another. Regional sympathetic activity is best studied in humans by recording from postganglionic sympathetic efferents (multiunit or single fiber recording) and by isotope dilution-derived measurement of organ-specific norepinephrine release to plasma (regional ""norepinephrine spillover""). Evidence assembled in this review indicates that sympathetic nervous system abnormalities are crucial in the development of cardiovascular disorders, notably heart failure, essential hypertension, disorders of postural circulatory control causing syncope, and ""psychogenic heart disease,"" heart disease attributable to mental stress and psychiatric illness. These abnormalities involve persistent, adverse activation of sympathetic outflows to the heart and kidneys in heart failure and hypertension, episodic or ongoing cardiac sympathetic activation in psychogenic heart disease, and defective sympathetic circulatory reflexes in disorders of postural circulatory control. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this ""mechanisms-to-management"" transition is at differing stages of development with the different conditions. Clinical translation is mature in cardiac failure, knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. With essential hypertension, perhaps we are on the cusp of effective translation, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on demonstration of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow. With psychogenic heart disease and postural syncope syndromes, knowledge of the neural pathophysiology is emerging, but clinical translation remains for the future."

A C. jejuni microarray-based screen revealed that several known virulence genes and several uncharacterized genes, including spoT, were rapidly upregulated during infection of human epithelial cells. spoT and its homologue relA have been shown in other bacteria to regulate the stringent response, an important stress response that to date had not been demonstrated for C. jejuni or any other epsilon-proteobacteria. We have found that C. jejuni mounts a stringent response that is regulated by spoT. Detailed analyses of a C. jejuniDelta spoT mutant revealed that the stringent response is required for several specific stress, transmission and antibiotic resistance-related phenotypes. These include stationary phase survival, growth and survival under low CO2/highO(2) conditions, and rifampicin resistance. A secondary suppressor strain that specifically rescues the low CO2 growth defect of the DeltaspoT mutant was also isolated. The stringent response additionally proved to be required for the virulence-related phenotypes of adherence, invasion, and intracellular survival in two human epithelial cell culture models of infection; spoT is the first C. jejuni gene shown to participate in longer term survival in epithelial cells. Microarray analyses comparing wild-type to the DeltaspoT mutant also revealed a strong correlation between gene expression profiles and phenotype differences observed. Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for the C. jejuni stringent response in multiple aspects of C. jejuni biology and pathogenesis and, further, may lend novel insight into unexplored features of the stringent response in other prokaryotic organisms."

The number of confirmed cases of human campylobacteriosis in the European Union followed a significant increasing trend in the period 2008-2012, and continued to be the most commonly reported zoonosis with 214,779 confirmed cases in 2013; the notification of human campylobacteriosis is today mandatory in most European Member States. Recent reports from the European Food Safety Authority have identified catering (catering services, restaurants, hotels, pubs, bars) as the most frequently reported setting for Campylobacter infection (EFSA and ECDC, 2015). As can be evinced from the analysis of the scientific literature, the quality of raw meat has been identified as a parameter of fundamental importance, but the contribution of incorrect food handling procedures is by no means negligible. In fact, poor hygiene during poultry meat preparation as well as inadequate cooking and cross-contamination between raw meat and ready-to-eat food were found to be the main causes for the spread of campylobacteriosis related to the catering industry.

Within months, additional cases were described, mostly in frontline troops, and the new disease was called trench fever. More than 1 million troops were infected with trench fever during World War 1, with each affected soldier unfit for duty for more than 60 days. Diagnosis was challenging, because there were no pathognomonic signs and symptoms and the causative organism could not be cultured. For 3 years, the transmission and cause of trench fever were hotly debated. In 1918, two commissions identified that the disease was louse-borne. The bacterium Rickettsia quintana was consistently found in the gut and faeces of lice that had fed on patients with trench fever and its causative role was accepted in the 1920s. The organism was cultured in the 1960s and reclassified as Bartonella quintana; it was also found to cause endocarditis, peliosis hepatis, and bacillary angiomatosis. Subsequently, B quintana infection has been identified in new populations in the Andes, in homeless people in urban areas, and in individuals with HIV. The story of trench fever shows how war can lead to the recrudescence of an infectious disease and how medicine approached an emerging infection a century ago."

Here we present the first global transcriptome analysis of the Old World vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis, Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) and compare this transcriptome to that of the New World vector of visceral leishmaniasis, Lutzomyia longipalpis. A normalized cDNA library was constructed using pooled mRNA from Phlebotomus papatasi larvae, pupae, adult males and females fed sugar, blood, or blood infected with Leishmania major. A total of 47615 generated sequences was cleaned and assembled into 17120 unique transcripts. Of the assembled sequences, 50% (8837 sequences) were classified using Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

These effects may be especially relevant to pathogen-host interactions. A detailed understanding of how and when spatial structure will affect the evolution of pathogen traits is likely to aid our ability to control rapidly emerging infectious diseases. Here we review a growing body of theoretical studies suggesting that spatial structure can lead to the evolution of an intermediate pathogen transmission rate and virulence. We explain the results of these studies in terms of a competition-persistence trade-off. These studies strongly suggest that local host interactions, local host dispersal, and relatively low host reproduction rates create a host population spatial structure that enforces this trade-off and leads to the evolution of lower pathogen transmission rates and virulence. They also suggest that when spatial structure exists, it can dominate over the shape of the transmission-virulence trade-off in determining pathogen traits. We also identify important areas of future research, including quantifying pathogen fitness in a spatial context in order to gain a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of spatial structure and observationally and experimentally testing theoretical predictions."

These peptides frequently display cytolytic activities against a range of pathogenic bacteria and fungi consistent with the idea that they play a role in the host's system of innate immunity. However, the importance of the peptides in the survival strategy of the animal is not clearly understood. It is a common misconception that antimicrobial peptides are synthesized in the skins of all anurans. In fact, the species distribution is sporadic suggesting that their production may confer some evolutionary advantage to the organism but is not necessary for survival. Although growth inhibitory activity against the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, responsible for anuran population declines worldwide, has been demonstrated in vitro, the ability of frog skin antimicrobial peptides to protect the animal in the wild appears to be limited and there is no clear correlation between their production by a species and its resistance to fatal chytridiomycosis. The low potency of many frog skin antimicrobial peptides is consistent with the hypothesis that cutaneous symbiotic bacteria may provide the major system of defense against pathogenic microorganisms in the environment with antimicrobial peptides assuming a supplementary role in some species."

However, a careful examination of discovery rates of new human RNA virus species, genera and families challenges this view, raising the possibility that this diversity is much more limited. Moreover, there is some evidence that the cast of human viruses is dynamic, with existing viruses disappearing (at least from humans) and new viruses appearing (perhaps evolving) over timescales of decades. Most of these new viruses, however, remain rare; only a small (but highly significant) minority are capable of spreading extensively through human populations."

New roles have not materialized for donkeys and mules that continue to perform their traditional activities. Disease control is assured mainly by public services acting within laws governing diseases and welfare. African horse sickness, glanders, dourine, equine infectious anemia, vesicular stomatitis, equine encephalomyelitis, anthrax, and rabies are notifiable diseases but none of the mainly equine diseases has been reported in Turkey for many years. Several zoonoses, including toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, listeriosis, and Rhodococcus infections, have been identified by serodiagnosis over wide areas, but animals carrying antibodies rarely exhibit clinical symptoms. Among other diseases in Turkish Equidae are piroplasmosis, respiratory infections, contagious equine metritis and equine influenza. Other viral and bacterial pathogens have been identified in isolated investigations. Internal and external parasites are a major cause of economic loss. Much research on equine diseases has been undertaken in the last decade of the 20th and first decade of the 21st centuries, perhaps because of Turkey's possible accession to the European Union and the goal to harmonize identification and control procedures and also because of the country's increasing participation in international equine events.

By explaining a number of the legal requirements necessary to mitigate such threats, this Article identifies legal principles that apply equally to natural threats throughout the global commons. The law involved in this analysis arises, in great part, from the judicial recognition of a state's duty of self-preservation. To this end, the American civil defense experience provides guidance on the extent of a government's duty to plan for the unknown, as does the Vorsorgeprinzip in Germany. At the international level, the doctrine of ""cooperative preservation"" requires nations to cooperate in joint preventive actions to mitigate dangers so great that no single country alone could effectively protect its citizens from the harm. In order to obtain greater insight into developing an international framework for mitigating extreme natural disasters, this Article considers examples of the law applied to existing efforts to mitigate transboundary nuclear and biochemical disasters, multinational forest fires, and the spread of new and re-emerging infectious diseases across international borders."

However, the various mechanisms of agriculture-induced evolution and their socio-ecological consequences are not often synthetically discussed. Here, we explore how agricultural practices and evolutionary changes in domesticated species cause evolution in wild species. We do so by examining three processes by which agriculture drives evolution. First, differences in the traits of domesticated species, compared with their wild ancestors, alter the selective environment and create opportunities for wild species to specialize. Second, selection caused by agricultural practices, including both those meant to maximize productivity and those meant to control pest species, can lead to pest adaptation. Third, agriculture can cause nonselective changes in patterns of gene flow in wild species. We review evidence for these processes and then discuss their ecological and sociological impacts. We finish by identifying important knowledge gaps and future directions related to the eco-evolutionary impacts of agriculture including their extent, how to prevent the detrimental evolution of wild species, and finally, how to use evolution to minimize the ecological impacts of agriculture.

4345,Cecilia,NO,NA,"Johnson, PTJ; Paull, SH",the ecology and emergence of diseases in fresh waters,2011,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Web of Science,"P>1. Freshwater ecosystems, including ponds, lakes, streams and rivers, represent an interaction nexus between environmental change and a wide variety of infectious diseases, including human malaria, salmonid whirling disease, amphibian chytridiomycosis, crayfish plague and many others. However, few studies have explicitly examined patterns of disease in fresh waters and how they are changing over time. 2. Freshwater environments can function as transmission foci for pathogens because of (i) the importance of fresh water for organism survival, (ii) the aquatic life histories of many vectors and intermediate hosts, (iii) the concentrated aggregations of species - both freshwater and terrestrial - in and around freshwater habitats and (iv) the highly altered condition of freshwater ecosystems, which can affect species interactions and disease pathology. 3. To determine whether water-related diseases in wildlife are increasing, we used generalised additive models to quantitatively assess trends in the scientific literature (1970-2009) for major freshwater groups, including amphibians, molluscs, crayfishes, fishes, mammals, reptiles and birds. We further examined what types of pathogens were primarily responsible for observed patterns and whether recurrent groups or transmission modes could be identified. 4. After correcting for research effort and temporal autocorrelation, we find that reports of disease varied over time and across freshwater taxa, with significant increases in amphibians, fishes and crayfishes, a significant decrease in molluscs, and no significant change in freshwater reptiles, birds or mammals. The types and diversity of pathogens varied considerably among groups. Reports of infection in amphibians were dominated by helminths and a chytridiomycete, in crayfishes by viruses and fungi, in molluscs by digenetic trematodes, in birds, fishes and mammals by viruses, protists and helminths and in reptiles by helminths and bacteria. 5. These results provide some of the first quantitative evidence indicative of a long-term increase in disease-related research for freshwater taxa. Managing freshwater ecosystems to reduce or minimise human and wildlife disease risk - arguably one of the most significant ecosystem services - will require enhanced incorporation of ecological approaches alongside medical and veterinary tools."

Given that wild birds are recognised as pathogen-dispersing agents, there is concern that changes in migrant ranges and movement patterns will increase the frequency of bird-borne pathogens reaching Northern areas, such as Canada. Furthermore, climate change will likely affect vector, pathogen, and reservoir ecology, which could contribute to changes in the range limits, the intensity of disease transmission and, under some circumstances, the risk of emergence and re-emergence of pathogens affecting commercial poultry. However, the role of wild birds in the perpetuation of disease is unclear. Even if climate change increases the introduction of zoonotic and bird-borne pathogens into Canada, it is difficult to predict whether this will increase the occurrence of diseases in poultry. It is likely that outbreaks will become more unpredictable, which will complicate efforts to identify periods and areas of high risk. Efforts to manage and control these events in the face of climate change will require proper biosecurity measures, in addition to more consistent surveillance of sentinel and high-risk carrier species to avert the potential risk of diseases dispersing into Canada."

Invasions can impact on parasite communities through both the introduction of exotic parasite species and effects of invading hosts on native parasite dynamics. However, our understanding of the factors that influence the invasive process and mediate impacts on native hosts and parasites is limited. 2. Using models of hostparasite dynamics as a framework, we explore how both the probability of spread for an exotic parasite and impacts of introduced species on native parasite dynamics depend on key parameters related to rates of encounter, transmission, mortality and recovery. We examine how invasions may interact with the diverse range of underlying biological mechanisms that can affect these rates. We specifically highlight the potential role of interactions between parasites, which has largely been ignored. 3. For introduced parasites, high abundance of competent hosts and vectors within native communities can greatly facilitate spread. Introduced host species can cause amplification or dilution effects for native parasite dynamics, with the direction and magnitude of the effect determined by how the invasion influences the competency and abundance or relative abundance of the host community (community capacity). 4. Invasions by exotic parasites and changes to endemic parasite dynamics following invasions may reflect numerical and functional processes in multihost single-parasite systems (e.g. influence of host and vector community structure on encounter rates). However, as co-infection can influence factors such as susceptibility and infection length, effects may also be mediated by within-host interactions between parasites. The ultimate effect of an invasion will depend on the community-wide summed direct and indirect impacts. 5. Future studies should aim to further elucidate the key processes influencing disease dynamics in multihost (and multivector) communities, thereby informing predictions of how invasive host and parasite species and changes in biodiversity will influence disease risk. Theoretical studies should incorporate host interspecific competition and relax assumptions regarding the relationship between intra- and interspecific contact rates and density. Empirical and experimental studies should not only quantify the relative importance of host (and vector) density and diversity, but also consider other community interactions such as those between parasites."

Each of these social shifts can affect the maintenance and emergence of arthropod vectors disease or the pathogenic organisms themselves. A good example is the country of Pakistan, with a large rural population and developing urban economy, it also maintains a wide diversity of entomological disease vectors, including biting flies, mosquitoes, and ticks. Pathogens endemic to the region include the agents of piroplasmosis, rickettsiosis, spirochetosis, and viral hemorrhagic fevers and encephalitis. The northwestern region of the country, including the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), formerly the North-West Frontier Provence (NWFP), and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are mountainous regions with a high degree of habitat diversity that has recently undergone a massive increase in human population density due to an immigrating refugee population from neighboring war-torn Afghanistan. Vector-borne diseases in people and livestock are common in KPK and FATA regions due to the limited use of vector control measures and access to livestock vaccines. The vast majority of people in this region live in abject poverty with >70% of the population living directly from production gained in animal husbandry. In many instances whole families live directly alongside their animal counterparts. In addition, there is little to no awareness of the threat posed by ticks and transmission of either zoonotic or veterinary pathogens. Recent emergence of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in rural populations, outbreaks of Dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported in the region, and high prevalence of cattle infected and co-infected with multiple species of hemoparasites (Theileria, Babesia, Anaplasma). The emergence of which has followed the increased density of the rural population due to an influx of refugees from violent conflicts in Afghanistan and is exacerbated by an already impoverished society and wide diversity of potential arthropod vectors.

The introduction of this pathogen into new locations and hosts has been shown to produce high morbidity and mortality, a situation observed recently in Australian and North American wildlife. Of the seven native animal species in Australia known to be infested by S. scabiei, the bare-nosed wombat (Vombatus ursinus) suffers the greatest with significant population declines having been observed in New South Wales and Tasmania. The origins of sarcoptic mange in Australian native animals are poorly understood, with the most consistent conclusion being that mange was introduced by settlers and their dogs and subsequently becoming a major burden to native wildlife. Four studies exist addressing the origins of mange in Australia, but all Australian S. scabiei samples derive from only two of these studies. This review highlights this paucity of phylogenetic knowledge of S. scabiei within Australia, and suggests further research is needed to confidently determine the origin, or multiple origins, of this parasite. At the global scale, numerous genetic studies have attempted to reveal how the host species and host geographic location influence S. scabiei phylogenetics. This review includes an analysis of the global literature, revealing that inconsistent use of gene loci across studies significantly influences phylogenetic inference. Furthermore, by performing a contemporary analytical approach on existing data, it is apparent that (i) new S. scabiei samples, (ii) appropriate gene loci targets, and (iii) advanced phylogenetic approaches are necessary to more confidently comprehend the origins of mange in Australia. Advancing this field of research will aid in understanding the mechanisms of spillover for mange and other parasites globally."

This article proposes to emphasize biological control among other techniques in mosquito control, and to assess the potential and the opportunities offered by entomopathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi. Finally, their use as biopesticides is discussed."

Yet, until recently, fungi received scant consideration in ecology, especially invasion ecology. Their under-representation is largely the result of a lack of scientific knowledge of fungal biodiversity and ecology. With the exception of pathogenic fungi, which cause emergent infectious diseases, the impact of fungal invasions is often difficult to quantify owing to limited baseline data on fungal communities. Here, we aim to raise awareness among mycologists and ecologists of the fungal dimension of invasions and of the need to intensify research in fungal ecology to address issues of future introductions."

To combat the toxic effects of this nitrosative stress, C. jejuni upregulates a small regulon under the control of the transcriptional activator NssR, which positively regulates the expression of a single-domain globin protein (Cgb) and a truncated globin protein (Ctb). Cgb has previously been shown to detoxify nitric oxide, but the role of Ctb remains contentious. As C. jejuni is amenable to genetic manipulation, and its globin proteins are easily expressed and purified, a combination of mutagenesis, complementation, transcriptomics, spectroscopic characterisation and structural analyses has been used to probe the regulation, function and structure of Cgb and Ctb. This ability to study Cgb and Ctb with such a multi-pronged approach is a valuable asset, especially since only a small fraction of known globin proteins have been functionally characterised."

In South Africa rising wealth, urbanisation and a growing middle class means South Africans are eating more processed and high-protein foods, especially meat and dairy products. These foods are more land- and water-intensive than fruit, vegetable and grain crops, and further stress existing resources. Traditional agricultural farms cannot keep up with the increasing demand for animal products and these farms are being replaced with concentrated animal feeding operations. There are a wide variety of problems caused by intensive livestock production. The concerns regarding factory farming in South Africa are social issues affecting food security, health concerns, environmental concerns and ethical concerns. In order to ensure food security in future we need to consider these concerns and support more sustainable systems to produce our food. Animal agriculture, like many other industries, works on the principles of supply and demand. By decreasing the demand for these products, we can decrease their production. Individuals can do this by becoming vegetarian or vegan, but also by simply cutting down one's consumption of meat, eggs, and milk produced in intensive livestock farms. Less meat would be produced, and there would be less harm to local communities, lower risk of zoonotic disease outbreaks, fewer greenhouse gas emissions, less land degradation and decrease of biodiversity, less damage to our water supplies and fewer animals living lives of suffering in factory farms."

The One Health concept is not new, but under its umbrella, a new generation of veterinarians, physicians, ecologists, biologists, and social scientists is shaping the concept in novel ways. This has led to increased support for One Health initiatives to control disease by international agencies, national governments, and nongovernmental organizations as well as a growing emphasis on One Health concepts in training the veterinary workforce.

Nonetheless, certain HIV-1-infected persons appear to act as long-term non-progressors, and elite control is associated with the presence of particular MHC class I allotypes such as HLA-B*27 or -B*57. The HIV-1 pandemic in humans arose from the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz originating from chimpanzees. Chimpanzees, however, appear to be relatively resistant to developing AIDS after HIV-1/SIVcpz infection. Mounting evidence illustrates that, in the distant past, chimpanzees experienced a selective sweep resulting in a severe reduction of their MHC class I repertoire. This was most likely caused by an HIV-1/SIV-like retrovirus, suggesting that chimpanzees may have experienced long-lasting host-virus relationships with SIV-like viruses. Hence, if natural selection is allowed to follow its course, prospects for the human population may look grim, thus underscoring the desperate need for an effective vaccine."

Although the concept of vaccination dates back to the late 1800s with Edward Jenner, it is only in the past decade that modern immunologic tools have been applied toward deciphering poxvirus immunity. Smallpox vaccines containing vaccinia virus elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses that confer cross-protective immunity against variola virus for decades after immunization.

These areas are used by humans for both commercial and recreational activities and are therefore protected by a range of European Directives. If water quality declines in these zones, significant economic losses can occur. Identifying the sources of pollution, however, is notoriously difficult due to the ephemeral nature of discharges, their diffuse source, and uncertainties associated with transport and transformation of the pollutants through the freshwater-marine interface. Further, significant interaction between nutrients, microorganisms and particulates can occur in the water column making prediction of the fate and potential infectivity of human pathogenic organisms difficult to ascertain. This interaction is most prevalent in estuarine environments due to the formation of flocs (suspended sediment) at the marine-freshwater interface. A range of physical, chemical and biological processes can induce the co-flocculation of microorganisms, organic matter and mineral particles resulting in pathogenic organisms becoming potentially protected from a range of biotic (e.g. predation) and abiotic stresses (e.g. UV, salinity). These flocs contain and retain macro-and micro-nutrients allowing the potential survival, growth and transfer of pathogenic organisms to commercially sensitive areas (e.g. beaches, shellfish harvesting waters). The flocs can either be transported directly to the coastal environment or can become deposited in the estuary forming cohesive sediments where pathogens can survive for long periods. Especially in response to storms, these sediments can be subsequently remobilised releasing pulses of potential pathogenic organisms back into the water column leading to contamination of marine waters long after the initial contamination event occurred. Further work, however, is still required to understand and predict the potential human infectivity of pathogenic organisms alongside the better design of early warning systems and surveillance measures for risk assessment purposes."

Where multiple risk drivers interact, the potential impact of a disease outbreak is amplified. The varying temporal and geographic frequency with which infectious disease events occur adds yet another layer of complexity to the issue. Mitigating the emergence and spread of infectious disease necessitates mapping and prioritising the interdependencies between public health and other sectors. Conversely, during an international public health emergency, significant disruption occurs not only to healthcare systems but also to a potentially wide range of sectors, including trade, tourism, energy, civil protection, transport, agriculture, and so on. At the same time, dealing with a disease outbreak may require a range of critical sectors for support.

It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional 'landscapes' such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field."

This neglect is, in part, a consequence of under-reporting, resulting in an underestimation of their global burden that downgrades their relevance to policy-makers and funding agencies. Increasing awareness about the causes of NZDs and how they can be prevented could reduce the incidence of many endemic zoonoses. Addressing NZDs by targeting the animal reservoir can deliver a double benefit, as enhanced animal health means a reduced risk of infection for humans, as well as improved livelihoods through increased animal productivity. Advocacy for NZD control is increasing, but with it comes a growing awareness that NZD control demands activities both in the short term and over a long period of time. Moreover, despite the promise of cheap, effective vaccines or other control tools, these endemic diseases will not be sustainably controlled in the near future without long-term financial commitment, particularly as disease incidence decreases and other health priorities take hold. NZD intervention costs can seem high when compared with the public health benefits alone, but these costs are easily outweighed when a full cross-sector analysis is carried out and monetary/non-monetary benefits particularly regarding the livestock sector are taken into account. Public private partnerships have recently provided advocacy for human disease control, and could prove equally effective in addressing endemic zoonoses through harnessing social impact investments. Evidence of the disease burdens imposed on communities by the NZDs and demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of integrated control can strengthen the case for a One Health approach to endemic zoonotic disease control.

Some of these species, in particular Helicobacter hepaticus and Helicobacter bilis, cause disease in immunocompromised and immunocompetent laboratory mice, rats and/or hamsters. In addition, subclinical infections with these bacteria may interfere with results obtained from experimental research in these animals and thus may lead to faulty interpretation of the data. Some laboratory rodent-associated Helicobacter species may also be considered zoonotic agents. Apart from Helicobacter hepaticus, the pathogenesis of Helicobacter infections has not been studied extensively, a fact which means there are substantial gaps in the comprehension of the virulence mechanisms of enterohepatic Helicobacter species associated with laboratory rodents. For all these reasons, the potential importance of these bacterial pathogens cannot be overlooked and undoubtedly merits further investigation."

Since World War I, infectious diseases have no longer been the main causes of morbidity and mortality among soldiers. However, most recent conflicts involving Western armies have occurred overseas, increasing the risk of vector-borne disease for the soldiers and for the displaced populations. The threat of vector-borne disease has changed with the progress in hygiene and disease control within the military: some diseases have lost their military significance (e.g. plague, yellow fever, and epidemic typhus); others remain of concern (e.g. malaria and dengue fever); and new potential threats have appeared (e.g. West Nile encephalitis and chikungunya fever). For this reason, vector control and personal protection strategies are always major requirements in ensuring the operational readiness of armed forces. Scientific progress has allowed a reduction in the impact of arthropod-borne diseases on military forces, but the threat is always present, and a failure in the context of vector control or in the application of personal protection measures could allow these diseases to have the same devastating impact on human health and military readiness as they did in the past."

The clinical picture is dominated by orthostatic hypotension, but supine hypertension is also a significant problem. Autonomic failure can result from impairment of central autonomic pathways (multiple system atrophy) or neurodegeneration of peripheral postganglionic autonomic fibers (pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease). Pharmacologic probes such as the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan can help us in the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of these disorders. Conversely, understanding the pathophysiology is crucial in the development of effective pharmacotherapy for these patients. Autonomic failure patients provide us with an unfortunate but unique research model characterized by loss of baroreflex buffering. This greatly magnifies the effect of stimuli that would not be apparent in normal subjects. An example of this is the discovery of the osmopressor reflex: ingestion of water increases blood pressure by 30-40 mm Hg in autonomic failure patients. Animal studies indicate that the trigger of this reflex is related to hypo-osmolality in the portal circulation involving transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 receptors. Studies in autonomic failure patients have also revealed that angiotensin II can be generated through noncanonical pathways independent of plasma renin activity to contribute to hypertension. Similarly, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone produces acute hypotensive effects, highlighting the presence of non-nuclear mineralocorticoid receptor pathways. These are examples of careful clinical research that integrates pathophysiology and pharmacology to advance our knowledge of human disease."

Similarly, the description of chronic forms of hepatitis E in immunocompromised patients raises the question of the treatment and prevention of this disease. Recent advances in the identification of animal reservoirs of HEV have confirmed that the strains circulating in domestic and wild pigs are genetically close to strains identified in indigenous cases. Characterization of HEV infection in swine herds has identified risk factors associated to the virus spreading.

BKV reactivation and disease can occur in immunosuppressed individuals, such as those who have undergone renal transplantation or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Clinical manifestations of BKV disease include graft dysfunction and failure in renal transplant recipients; HCT recipients frequently experience hematuria, cystitis, hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), and renal dysfunction. Studies of HCT patients have identified several risk factors for the development of BKV disease including myeloablative conditioning, acute graft-versus-host disease, and undergoing an umbilical cord blood (uCB) HCT. Although these risk factors indicate that alterations in the immune system are necessary for BKV pathogenesis in HCT patients, few studies have examined the interactions between host immune responses and viral reactivation in BKV disease. Specifically, having BKV immunoglobulin-G before HCT does not protect against BKV infection and disease after HCT. A limited number of studies have demonstrated BKV-specific cytotoxic T cells in healthy adults as well as in post-HCT patients who had experienced HC. New areas of research are required for a better understanding of this emerging infectious disease post HCT, including prospective studies examining BK viruria, viremia, and their relationship with clinical disease, a detailed analysis of urothelial histopathology, and laboratory evaluation of systemic and local cellular and humoral immune responses to BKV in patients receiving HCT from different sources, including uCB and haploidentical donors."

Key species produced include lobsters (Homarus gammarus), edible crabs (Cancer pagurus), langoustines (Nephrops norvegicus), flat oysters (Ostrea edulis), cockles (Cerestoderma edule) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). The role played by infectious disease in limiting the sustainability of the production of these species is largely neglected. This review summarizes our knowledge of the key diseases of commercially important crustaceans and bivalve molluscs and attempts to determine their role in limiting the population of animals available for food production both at present and in the future. It shows that the key diseases threatening the sustainability of shellfish production are bitter crab disease in langoustines and edible crabs, and a wide range of diseases caused by micro- and macro-parasites in some bivalve molluscs including oysters and cockles. Oceanographic models are also employed to predict how changes in climate over the next half century may affect these key diseases and their hosts as found in the Irish Sea. It is concluded that the paucity of information on the potential transfer of some disease agents in pelagic larval stages of hosts and vectors is a major hurdle in predicting how some changes in environmental conditions may influence the prevalence and severity of shellfish diseases in coming years."

Seroprevalence studies suggest that Q fever was endemic in The Netherlands several decades before the disease was diagnosed in dairy goats and dairy sheep. This was in 2005 and the increase in humans started in 2007. Q fever abortions were registered on 30 dairy goat and dairy sheep farms between 2005 and 2009.

This might be explained by the complex relationship between climate change and the frequency and the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, which is characterised by nonlinear associations and countless other complex factors governing the distribution of infectious diseases. Here, we explore whether and how climate change might impact on diseases targeted by the Regional Network for Asian Schistosomiasis and Other Helminth Zoonoses (RNAS(+)). We start our review with a short summary of the current evidence-base how climate change affects the distribution of infectious diseases. Next, we introduce biology-based models for predicting the distribution of infectious diseases in a future, warmer world. Two case studies are presented: the classical RNAS(+) disease schistosomiasis and an emerging disease, angiostrongyliasis, focussing on their occurrences in the People's Republic of China. Strengths and limitations of current models for predicting the impact of climate change on infectious diseases are discussed, and we propose model extensions to include social and ecological factors.

In the 19805, it was recognised that intense transmission associated with the disease was taking place in northern Togo and Ghana. Pathology can be severe and two clinical presentations, called 'Dapaong Tumour' and Multinodular disease', have been described. Lesions can now be efficiently and specifically visualised by ultrasound. The prevalence of infection appeared to be high in many villages, although its distribution was limited and focal. Parasitological diagnosis has been based on the demonstration of third-stage larvae in stool cultures and more recently on PCR. Molecular and epidemiological evidence supports the proposal that Oesophagostomum bifurcum infections of humans in Ghana and Togo represent a distinct genotype from that of non-human primates in the area. Mass treatment, using repeated doses of albendazole rapidly resulted in the effective elimination of human oesophagostomiasis in the affected areas. This review takes a historic perspective on oesophagostomiasis of humans. This chapter discusses how the unexpected success of mass treatment together with aberrant pathogenesis, the severity of pathology in humans and the limited geographic distribution of the parasite all reflect a poor adaptation of the parasite to the human host."

Many of these recent declines have been linked to a pathogenic skin fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or to iridoviruses of the genus Ranavirus. One of the first lines of defense against pathogens that enter by way of the skin are antimicrobial peptides synthesized and stored in dermal granular glands and secreted into the mucus following alarm or injury. Here, I review what is known about the capacity of amphibian antimicrobial peptides from diverse amphibians to inhibit B. dendrobatidis or ranavirus infections. When multiple species were compared for the effectiveness of their in vitro antimicrobial peptides defenses against B. dendrobatidis, non-declining species of rainforest amphibians had more effective antimicrobial peptides than species in the same habitat that had recently experienced population declines. Further, there was a significant correlation between the effectiveness of the antimicrobial peptides and resistance of the species to experimental infection. These studies support the hypothesis that antimicrobial, peptides are an important component of innate defenses against B. dendrobatidis. Some amphibian antimicrobial peptides inhibit ranavirus infections and infection of human T lymphocytes by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An effective antimicrobial peptide defense against skin pathogens appears to depend on a diverse array of genes expressing antimicrobial peptides. The production of antimicrobial peptides may be regulated by signals from the pathogens. However, this defense must also accommodate potentially beneficial microbes on the skin that compete or inhibit growth of the pathogens. How this delicate balancing act is accomplished is an important area of future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

One of the most consistent molecular features of emerging arboviruses, in addition to their near exclusive use of RNA genomes, is the inclusion of viral, non-structural proteins that act as interferon antagonists.

Moreover, it targets and manipulates numerous host cell signaling pathways, thereby ameliorating the otherwise bactericidal capacity. Many of the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unknown but key elements, directly or indirectly responsible for many of the aforementioned mechanisms, rely on the expression of proteins encoded by the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI), suggested to constitute a type VI secretion system.

It is increasingly clear, however, that parasite-host interactions may represent a large, and important, component of natural communities.

Only recently has the role of factors such as trematode parasite infections been incorporated into studies of the population and community dynamics of aquatic systems. We argue that this is due, at least in part, to difficulties faced by aquatic ecologists in sifting through the complex systematics that pervade the parasite literature. We note that two trematode species are of dominant importance with regard to North American larval anuran communities, and provide in this review a clear explanation of how to distinguish between the infective stages of these two parasites.

As there are indications for a role of rodents in Q-fever epidemiology, including during the 2007-10 outbreak in the Netherlands, the overall lack of knowledge on the role of rodents warrants studies into their contribution in transmission of C. burnetii from the sylvatic cycle to the domestic cycle, in within-herd transmission, in transmission to surrounding farms and in direct transmission to humans. Although the basic sylvatic and domestic cycles of C. burnetii infection can operate independently, they will overlap in many instances as many areas in the world are occupied by both domestic and wild animals. This area of Q-fever ecology is of interest and research should focus on this aspect of Q-fever epidemiology and, in particular, on the role of rodents therein. More studies are needed that elicit the exact role of rodents in epidemiology of C. burnetii to further optimise disease control."

Method All existing Chinese SARS data sources were integrated in one final database. This involved removing non-probable and duplicate cases, adding cases at the final stage of the outbreak, and collecting missing information. Results The resulting database contains a total of 5327 probable SARS cases, of whom 343 died, giving a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4%. While the total number of cases happens to be equal to the original official reports, there are 5 cases overall which did not result in death. When compared with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, China Taiwan, and Singapore, the SARS epidemic in mainland China resulted in a considerably lower CFR, involved relatively younger cases and included fewer health care workers. Conclusions To optimise future data collection during large-scale outbreaks of emerging or re-emerging infectious disease, China must further improve the infectious diseases reporting system, enhance collaboration between all levels of disease control, health departments, hospitals and institutes nationally and globally, and train specialized staff working at county centres of disease control."

The resurgence and epidemiology of zoonoses are complex and dynamic, being influenced by varying parameters that can roughly be categorized as human-related, pathogen-related, and climate/environment-related; however, there is significant interplay between these factors. Human-related factors include modern life trends such as ecotourism, increased exposure through hunting or pet owning, and culinary habits, industrialization sequelae such as farming/food chain intensification, globalization of trade, human intrusion into ecosystems and urbanization, significant alterations in political regimes, conflict with accompanying breakdown of public health and surveillance infrastructure, voluntary or involuntary immigration, loosening of border controls, and hierarchy issues in related decision-making, and scientific advances that allow easier detection of zoonotic infections and evolution of novel susceptible immunocompromised populations. Pathogen-related factors include alterations in ecosystems and biodiversity that influence local fauna synthesis, favouring expansion of disease hosts or vectors, pressure for virulence/resistance selection, and genomic variability. Climate/environment-related factors, either localized or extended, such as El Nino southern oscillation or global warming, may affect host-vector life cycles through varying mechanisms. Emerging issues needing clarification include the development of predictive models for the infectious disease impact of environmental projects, awareness of the risk imposed on immunocompromised populations, recognition of the chronicity burden for certain zoonoses, and the development of different evaluations of the overall stress imposed by a zoonotic infection on a household, and not strictly a person."

Infection affects not only cattle but also other livestock species, companion animals and wild mammals. Humans are also susceptible; hence, zoonotic infection is a driver for disease control in animal hosts. As bovine TB prevalence has been reduced in livestock, the relative epidemiological and socio-economic importance of wildlife reservoirs has increased, and there is a need for disease management strategies. 2 We review the current status of TB in European wild mammals, identifying epidemiological trends and areas for future research and management. TB has a complex epidemiology, which may involve multiple hosts, and is influenced by climate and habitat. 3 Consequently, the role of wild and domestic hosts in the epidemiology of TB varies among regions. In Europe, there are three regional examples of M. bovis maintenance hosts: the Eurasian badger Meles meles in Great Britain and Ireland, the Eurasian wild boar Sus scrofa in the Iberian Peninsula and deer belonging to the subfamily Cervinae in several European regions. In other parts of Europe, these species are currently regarded as spillover hosts, although in time their status may change depending on local or regional risk factors. Nevertheless, in most situations, the relative contribution of wild mammals to M. bovis infection in cattle is still a matter of debate. Also, the outcome of management interventions to control disease in wildlife populations may be complex and counter-intuitive. 4 As our knowledge of disease dynamics in wild mammals improves, options for disease control in wildlife reservoirs, such as vaccination, improved biosecurity and population management, are likely to broaden. In order to evaluate our existing control options, we must monitor the effects of interventions on TB occurrence in the affected regions of Europe and share our collective experiences."

Of increasing concern is the trans-kingdom tendency for increased pathogen virulence that is beginning to emerge in natural, clinical and agricultural settings. The study of pathogenicity has revealed multiple examples of convergently evolved virulence mechanisms. Originally described as rare, but increasingly common, are interactions where a single gene deletion in a pathogenic species causes hypervirulence. This review utilised the pathogen-host interaction database (www.PHI-base.org) to identify 112 hypervirulent mutations from 37 pathogen species, and subsequently interrogates the trans-kingdom, conserved, molecular, biochemical and cellular themes that cause hypervirulence. This study investigates 22 animal and 15 plant pathogens including 17 bacterial and 17 fungal species.

Mathematical models of infectious diseases permit quantitative description of epidemic processes based on the underlying biological mechanisms. Mathematical models have been widely used in the past decade to aid pandemic planning by allowing detailed predictions of the speed of spread of an influenza pandemic and the likely effectiveness of alternative control strategies. During the initial waves of the 2009 influenza pandemic, mathematical models were used to track the spread of the virus, predict the time course of the pandemic and assess the likely impact of large-scale vaccination. While mathematical modeling has made substantial contributions to influenza pandemic preparedness, its use as a realtime tool for pandemic control is currently limited by the lack of essential surveillance information such as serological data. Mathematical modeling provided a useful framework for analyzing and interpreting surveillance data during the 2009 influenza pandemic, for highlighting limitations in existing pandemic surveillance systems, and for guiding how these systems should be strengthened in order to cope with future epidemics of influenza or other emerging infectious diseases."

Our objective was to evaluate scientific literature investigating the potential association between these two diseases (MAP and CD) and the presence of MAP in retail milk or dairy products using a qualitative systematic review. Method: The search strategy included 19 bibliographic databases, 8 conference proceedings, reference lists of 15 articles and contacting 28 topic-related scientists. Two independent reviewers performed relevance screening, quality assessment and data extraction stages of the review. Results: Seventy-five articles were included. Among 60 case-control studies that investigated the association between MAP and CD, 37 were of acceptable quality. Twenty-three studies reported significant positive associations, 23 reported non-significant associations, and 14 did not detect MAP in any sample. Different laboratory tests, test protocols, types of samples and source populations were used in these studies resulting in large variability among studies. Seven studies investigated the association between CD and JD, two challenge trials reported contradictory results, one cross-sectional study did not support the association, and four descriptive studies suggested that isolated MAP is often closely related to cattle isolates. MAP detection in raw and pasteurized milk was reported in several studies. Conclusions: Evidence for the zoonotic potential of MAP is not strong, but should not be ignored. Interdisciplinary collaboration among medical, veterinary and other public health officials may contribute to a better understanding of the potential routes of human exposure to MAP."

Several case studies have indicated infection of humans by animal rotaviruses. Comparison of genetic sequences of human and animal rotaviruses often reveals close identity. Surveillance of circulating rotaviruses in the human population has revealed the presence of several uncommon genotypes. Many of these have been found in domestic animals, and it is possible that they arose in the human population through zoonotic transmission. The tow incidence of uncommon strains would suggest that such transmission, or at least the establishment of an animal rotavirus or a human/animal reassortant virus in the human population, does not happen with any great frequency. However, many millions of people will be exposed year on year to animal rotaviruses. This happens within farming communities, and potentially to visitors to the countryside. There may be some measure of environmental contamination through livestock excrement. This exposure may not result in high levels of infection, but some infection could occur. There may be a continual input of rotavirus strains or sequences into the human population from the animal population albeit at a very low level.

As no FDA-approved therapeutics are available for these infections, efforts to discover new therapeutics are important, especially because these pathogens are considered biothreats and emerging infectious diseases. All methods for discovering new therapeutics should be considered, including compound library screening in vitro against virus and in silico structure-based drug design, where possible, if sufficient biochemical and structural information is available. Areas covered: This review covers the structure and function of filovirus proteins, as they have been reported to date, as well as some of the current antiviral screening approaches. The authors discuss key studies mapping small-molecule modulators that were found through library and in silico screens to potential sites on viral proteins or host proteins involved in virus trafficking and pathogenesis. A description of ebolavirus and marburgvirus diseases and available animal models is also presented. Expert opinion: To discover novel therapeutics with potent efficacy using sophisticated computational methods, more high-resolution crystal structures of filovirus proteins and more details about the protein functions and host interaction will be required. Current compound screening efforts are finding active antiviral compounds, but an emphasis on discovery research to investigate protein structures and functions enabling in silico drug design would provide another avenue for finding antiviral molecules.

Recent findings Clinicopathological features associated with successful weaning include a lack of sensitization [negative donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and lack of tissue C4d deposits]; 'inexperienced' recipient immune system with limited potential for cross-reactivity (less immunological memory; infant recipients); noninflamed allograft in those with nonviral, nonimmunological original diseases; upregulation of liver genes associated with iron metabolism; allograft colonization with 'immunosuppressive' cells (Treg and gamma delta-1 > gamma delta-2); and longer time on immunosuppression, which might signal slow clonal deletion or silencing.

Conflicts have arisen between stakeholders who benefit from high ungulate numbers and those faced with the costs. Supplementary or diversionary feeding may potentially mitigate conflicts while maintaining harvest yields but can have conservation implications. We quantified the empirical evidence for whether the intended effects, and hence management goals, of feeding are met. We also examined whether any potential unintended consequences of feeding occur and under what conditions. We found clear evidence that supplementary feeding enhanced reproduction and population growth under certain conditions. By contrast, we found limited evidence of the effectiveness of diversionary feeding to protect crops, forestry, and natural habitats, with positive effects often undermined by increases in ungulate density. However, the use of diversionary feeding to reduce traffic collisions seems promising but requires further investigation. The unintended effects of feeding are typically complex, involving changes to demography, behavior, and vegetation with consequent cascading effects on other trophic levels, as well as exacerbated risks of disease transmission. Increased ungulate density is the primary driver behind these unintended effects, the consequences of which tend to increase with longevity of feeding and affect a range of stakeholders.

Purpose: To explore whether enhanced cooperation with local government and community institutions can effectively supplement traditional state-centric public health epidemic responses. Methods: Drawing on Taiwan as a case study, we assess the role of the whole-of-society approach to epidemic response as arises from the collaborative governance literature. The approach calls for enhanced cooperation, trust building, resource sharing and consensus-oriented decision making among multiple levels of government, business, non-profits, and the public in general. Results: The Taiwan case illustrates the benefits of the whole-of-society approach. Enhanced cooperation between state, local government and non-state institutions, particularly neighborhood committees, has resulted in a strengthened, holistic epidemic preparedness and response infrastructure.

Unlike other species of Schistosoma, over 40 species of wild and domestic animals can act as reservoir hosts of S. japonicum, which increases the difficulty for the control of this tropical disease. It is widely recognized that domestic animals, particularly water buffaloes and cattle, play an important role in the transmission of S. japonicum. Hence, since the 1950s when The People's Republic of China commenced fight against the disease, the control of animal schistosomiasis has been carried out almost synchronously with that of human schistosomiasis, such that great strides have been made over the past six decades. In this chapter, we review the history and current status of schistosomiasis control in domestic animals in The People's Republic of China. We thoroughly analyse the prevalence of domestic animal schistosomiasis at different stages of schistosomiasis control and the role of different species of domestic animals in transmission of the disease, summarize the control strategies and assess their effectiveness.

A common feature of the life cycles of these generally monoxenous nematodes is the significant participation of small rodents. In case of Toxocara spp., the rodent plays the role of paratenic host but optional intermediate host for T. leonina. Several studies indicate co-occurence of both T. canis and T. leonina in domestic and wild canids as well as T. cati and T. leonina in felids.

It is due to the presence of larvae of roundworms belonging to the genus Toxocara in the human body. Clinical signs are often non-specific. The disease can be asymptomatic or can lead to death. Toxocariasis can be thought of because of clinical signs or the presence of hypereosinophilia, but the diagnosis is made by specific serology. Since there is no consensus to date regarding treatment, prevention is of paramount importance. Current knowledge and keypoints.-Recent studies point out the frequency of this parasitic disease that is often asymptomatic. The serological diagnosis remains the main tool for the diagnosis of toxocariasis. Future prospects and projects.-Further studies on toxocariasis should focus on the prevalence of this disease in French population regarding the probability of infection: living in the countryside, food habits, hygiene and presence of dogs in the neighbourhood. Tools of the biological diagnosis (mainly serological techniques) should be improved, but, especially, studies should focus on the evaluation of specific treatment in order to give unquestionable guidelines on this point. c (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS.

We found 18 articles with original prevalence, incidence, or case data for toxocariasis. Prevalence estimates ranged from 0.6% in a Canadian Inuit community to 30.8% in Mexican children with asthma. Commonly cited risk factors included: African-American race, poverty, male sex, and pet ownership or environmental contamination by animal feces. Increased prevalence of Toxocara spp. infection was linked in a group of case control studies conducted in Mexico to several high risk groups including waste pickers, asthmatic children, and inpatient psychiatry patients. Further research is needed to determine the true current burden of toxocariasis in North America; however the prevalence estimates gathered in this review suggest that the burden of disease is significant."

In Mexico, this parasite has been detected in different parts of the country, particularly in the tropical areas where the parasite can remain infective for long periods of time due to the environmental conditions (i.e. high temperature and humidity over the whole year). Several epidemiological studies have been conducted in both human and animal populations, but despite the wide distribution of the agent in the country, there is a significant lack of knowledge on the parasite transmission, treatment alternatives and control measures. The lack of feral cat populations and control measures in sites of meat production for human consumption are playing a role that has led to the wide spread of the disease in the country, particularly in tropical areas of Southeastern Mexico. For these reasons, this manuscript aims to review the published information on relevant epidemiological aspects of infection with T. gondii in humans and animals from Mexico."

These viruses are transmitted to humans through contact with their respective South American rodent hosts. Each uses human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as its obligate receptor. Accidental similarities between human TfR1 and TfR1 orthologs of arenaviral host species enable zoonoses, whereas mice and rats are not infectable because they lack these TfR1 determinants of infection. All pathogenic New World arenaviruses bind to a common region of the apical domain of TfR1. The ability of a New World arenavirus to use human TfR1 is absolutely predictive of its ability to cause hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Nonpathogenic arenaviruses, closely related to hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, cannot utilize human TfR1 but efficiently enter cells through TfR1 orthologs of their native rodent hosts. Mutagenesis studies suggest that minor changes in the entry glycoproteins of these nonpathogenic viruses may allow human transmission. TfR1 is upregulated as a result of iron sequestration during the acute-phase response to infection, and the severity of disease may result from amplification of viral replication during this response."

In recent years, there have been a number of publications delineating this threat by providing evidence of the transmissibility of this virus through transfusions. The extent of transmission and its clinical relevance are issues under debate at present. HEV usually causes a self-limiting illness which subsides in a few weeks barring a few cases where fulminant hepatic failure occurs. The virus poses a risk of higher morbidity and mortality in pregnant females, patients with pre-existing liver disease and solid organ transplant recipients. As these categories of patient often require repeated transfusions or massive transfusions, they are exposed to a greater risk of transmission of HEV. At present, there is little evidence to advocate universal screening for this virus but considering that there is no definitive treatment for HEV induced hepatitis, selective screening should be advocated in blood products for high risk recipients in endemic areas."

It is motivated by the North American outbreak of West Nile virus, an emerging infectious disease that has prompted at least five dynamical modelling studies. Mathematical models have long proven successful in investigating the dynamics and control of infectious disease systems. The underlying assumptions in these epidemiological models determine their mathematical structure, and therefore influence their predictions. A crucial assumption is the host-vector interaction encapsulated in the disease-transmission term, and a key prediction is the basic reproduction number, R-0. We connect these two model elements by demonstrating how the choice of transmission term qualitatively and quantitatively alters R-0 and therefore alters predicted disease dynamics and control implications. Whereas some transmission terms predict that reducing the host population will reduce disease outbreaks, others predict that this will exacerbate infection risk. These conflicting predictions are reconciled by understanding that different transmission terms apply biologically only at certain population densities, outside which they can generate erroneous predictions. For West Nile virus, R-0 estimates for six common North American bird species indicate that all would be effective outbreak hosts."

Since their initial identification, numerous outbreaks have been reported, affecting both domestic animals and humans, and multiple rounds of person-to-person NiV transmission were observed. Widely distributed fruit bats from Pteropodidae family were found to be henipavirus natural reservoir. Numerous studies have reported henipavirus seropositivity in pteropid bats, including bats in Africa, thus expanding notably the geographic distribution of these viruses. Interestingly, henipavirus infection in bats seems to be asymptomatic, in contrast to severe disease induced in numerous other mammals. Unique among the mammals by their ability to fly, these intriguing animals are natural reservoir for many other emerging and remerging viruses highly pathogenic for humans. This feature, combined with absence of clinical symptoms, has attracted the interest of scientific community to virus-bat interactions. Therefore, several bat genomes were sequenced and particularities of the bat immune system have been intensively analyzed during the last decade to understand their coexistence with viruses in the absence of disease. The peculiarities in inflammasome activation, a constitutive expression of interferon alpha, and some differences in adaptive immunity have been recently reported in fruit bats. Studies on virus-bat interactions have thus emerged as an exciting novel area of research that should shed new light on the mechanisms that regulate viral infection and may allow development of novel therapeutic approaches to control this highly lethal emerging infectious disease in humans."

Although the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants is the recognised reservoir of this organism, E. coli O157 can persist for significant periods of time in animal manure and contaminated soil, from where it can be transferred to watercourses during periods of heavy rainfall. Freshwater ecosystems are often at the interface between agriculture and the wider environment and can play an important role in human exposure to E. coli O157, e.g. though contaminating drinking water, recreational surface waters and shellfish harvesting areas. To mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, it is essential to have a rapid, robust and reproducible method for the detection of waterborne E. coli O157. Because of the very low infective dose and the high background levels of non-target microbes, detection methods need to be extremely sensitive, and display a high level of specificity. In this review, we briefly outline the environmental pathways for the movement of E. coli O157 into watercourses, and critically assess the methods that are currently used to detect E. coli O157 in freshwater systems. Finally, we determine the suitability of each method for the rapid, accurate and affordable detection of waterborne E. coli O157 and consider some future directions for detecting human pathogens in the environment.

Unfortunately, antigenic drift and the high diversity of potential emerging zoonotic and pandemic viruses make it difficult to select the right strains for vaccine production. This problem causes vaccine mismatches, which lead to sharp drops in vaccine effectiveness and long response times to manufacture matched vaccines in case of novel pandemic viruses. Aims: To provide an overview of universal influenza virus vaccines and therapeutic antibodies in preclinical and clinical development. Sources: PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov were used as sources for this review. Content: Universal influenza virus vaccines that target conserved regions of the influenza virus including the haemagglutinin stalk domain, the ectodomain of the M2 ion channel or the internal matrix and nucleoproteins are in late preclinical and clinical development. These vaccines could confer broad protection against all influenza A and B viruses including drift variants and thereby abolish the need for annual re-formulation and re-administration of influenza virus vaccines.

Using a computerized MEDLINE search of published articles from January 1981 through October 2005, we conducted a literature review of practical epidemiologic aspects of HIV/AIDS among IDUs in the United States. Although recent trends indicate a decline in the Proportion of newly diagnosed HIV infections associated with injection drug use, drug-use behaviors overall still account for 32% of new HIV diagnoses. Factors in addition to syringe sharing contribute to HIV transmission among IDUs: risky sexual behaviors, sharing of drug preparation equipment and drug solutions, and contextual and social factors. Promising approaches for HIV prevention include rapid HIV testing, office-based substance abuse treatment, behavioral interventions, improved communication about syringe exchange programs, and case management.

Many of the emerging infectious diseases currently challenging human health in Europe are transmitted by ticks which normally feed on domestic or wild animals. Each Rickettsia spp. has one or several tick vectors, and their geographical distribution varies according to geographical conditions; e.g.; altitude or temperature, which is gradually changing due to a global warming. Evidence of Rickettsia spp. particularly of a newly discovered species is a strong indication that a great number of diseases may be caused by so far undetected or unrecognized organisms. Their diagnosis relies mostly on rare ""spot like"" cooperation of clinicians with scientists, the members of the working groups that are devoted to the scientific studies of the corresponding research areas. The clinical picture of the disease caused by rickettsiae varies significantly from flu like symptoms to severe fatal outcomes, reflecting the various factors, e.g. a variability of virulence of rickettsial species due to cell invasion, dissemination of rickettsiae, genomics, immune response of an infected organism, or a tricky impact of a treatment. Several major reviews on rickettsioses have been previously published, e.g. in 1997 (Raoult and Roux, 1997a), in 2005 (Parola et al., 2005), and in 2011 (Botelho-Nevers and Raoult, 2011).

Diphyllobothriosis, a human disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Diphyllobothrium, is the most important fish-borne zoonosis caused by a cestode parasite. Up to 20 million humans are estimated to be infected worldwide. Besides humans, definitive hosts of Diphyllobothrium include piscivorous birds and mammals, which represent a significant zoonotic reservoir. The second intermediate hosts include both freshwater and marine fish, especially anadromous species such as salmonids. The zoonosis occurs most commonly in countries where the consumption of raw or marinated fish is a frequent practice. Due to the increasing popularity of dishes utilizing uncooked fish, numerous cases of human infections have appeared recently, even in the most developed countries. As many as 14 valid species of Diphyllobothrium can cause human diphyllobothriosis, with D. latum and D. nihonkaiense being the most important pathogens. In this paper, all taxa from humans reported are reviewed, with brief information on their life history and their current distribution. Data on diagnostics, epidemiology, clinical relevance, and control of the disease are also summarized. The importance of reliable identification of human-infecting species with molecular tools (sequences of mitochondria genes) as well as the necessity of epidemiological studies aimed at determining the sources of infections are pointed out."

Here we report a recent increase in the elevational limit of anurans following glacial retreat in the tropical Peruvian Andes. Three species have colonized ponds in recently deglaciated terrain at new record elevations for amphibians worldwide (5244-5400 m). Two of these species were also found to be infected with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an emerging fungal pathogen causally associated with global amphibian declines, including the disappearance of several Latin American species. The presence of this pathogen was associated with elevated mortality rates of at least one species. These results represent the first evidence of upward expansion of anurans to newly available habitat brought about by recent deglaciation. Furthermore, the large increase in the upper limit of known Bd infections, previously reported as 4112 m in Ecuador, to 5348 m in this study, also expands the spatial domain of potential Bd pathogenicity to encompass virtually all high elevation anuran habitats in the tropical Andes."

In the 1940s, the introduction of antibiotics to treat infectious diseases revolutionized medicine. Unfortunately, antibiotics were used not only in medicine and to treat food animals, but also to prevent animals from contracting diseases and to promote their growth (antibiotic growth promoters - AGPs). These applications and misuse of antibiotics have resulted in the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, which causes treatment failures. This has important consequences for public health, as resistance genes can be passed on to people. The magnitude of the problem is illustrated by the fact that more than 25 000 people in the European Union die each year from infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of antimicrobials in animals can impact on public health. For example, the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in food animals is associated with the use of avoparcin, a glycopeptides antibiotic used as a feed additive for the growth promotion of animals. Because the use of AGPs has been shown to cause risks to human health, the European Union banned avoparcin in 1997, bacitracin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin in 1999, and other AGPs since 2006. The data shows that discontinuing the use of AGPs resulted in reducing the levels of resistance in animals and food, and consequently in humans. However, benefits from the widespread ban of AGPs needs to be more carefully weighed against the increase in usage of therapeutic antibiotics in food animals and the growing of resistance in zoonotic food borne bacteria, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter."

Our objectives were to evaluate published evidence on the treatment of chronic Chagas' disease with benznidazole and on the potential benefits of this drug in the chronic phase of the disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by means of an electronic search of the published literature, with no language restrictions, until October 2008. We included studies on chronically infected patients of any age who were in the indeterminate phase or had visceral involvement and for whom treatment with benznidazole was compared with placebo or no treatment. The primary endpoint was response to therapy (whether serological, parasitological or clinical), as it was measured in each of the studies included. Clinical response to therapy was also analysed. We identified 696 studies, from which we chose 9: 3 clinical trials and 6 observational studies. Compared with placebo or no treatment, benznidazole increases 18-fold the probability of a response to therapy [global odds ratio (OR), 18.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.2-68.3]. This effect was mainly observed in clinical trials (OR, 70.8; 95% CI, 16-314), whereas in observational studies it was much less marked (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 2.1-28.9), and even less so when only observational studies in adults were considered (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.6-24.7). Patients treated with benznidazole had a significantly lower risk of clinical events (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.53). Up to 18% of patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity (cutaneous reactions followed by gastrointestinal disturbances); this was less common in children than in adults. Analysis of available information reveals that the efficacy of treatment in late chronic infection is doubtful. Although data generally point to a beneficial effect, this could be marginal. This uncertainty is largely the result of differences in the study populations, endpoints and follow-up periods, and the fact that almost all of the information on treatment in the late chronic phase comes from non-randomized studies."

In addition, high-titer IGs (hyperimmune) against a specific pathogen can be obtained from vaccinated or convalescing donors. Currently, IGs can be used for the treatment of a variety of infections for which no specific therapy exists or that remain difficult to treat. Moreover, the recent pathogen outbreaks for which there is no approved treatment have renewed attention to the role of convalescent plasma and IGs.Areas covered: In this review, a historical perspective of the use of sera and IGs in humans as anti-infective agents (any viral, bacterial, parasitic infection), excluding immunodeficient patients, is presented from early development to the latest clinical studies. A Medline search was conducted to examine the peer-reviewed literature, with no date limits.Expert commentary: Human pooled plasma-derived IG products benefit from the polyclonal response of every individual donor and from the interindividual variability in such response. The trend to increased availability of vaccines for infectious diseases also opens new potential applications of hyperimmune IGs for emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g.: Ebola, Zika, Dengue), for the prevention and treatment in the general population, healthcare personnel and caregivers."

In amphibians, chytridiomycosis caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd, has severely affected many amphibian populations and species around the world. One promising management strategy is probiotic bioaugmentation of antifungal bacteria on amphibian skin. In vivo experimental trials using bioaugmentation strategies have had mixed results, and therefore a more informed strategy is needed to select successful probiotic candidates. Metagenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic methods, colloquially called ""omics,"" are approaches that can better inform probiotic selection and optimize selection protocols. The integration of multiple omic data using bioinformatic and statistical tools and in silico models that link bacterial community structure with bacterial defensive function can allow the identification of species involved in pathogen inhibition. We recommend using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and methods such as indicator species analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Measure, and co-occurrence networks to identify bacteria that are associated with pathogen resistance in field surveys and experimental trials. In addition to 16S amplicon sequencing, we recommend approaches that give insight into symbiont function such as shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, or metabolomics to maximize the probability of finding effective probiotic candidates, which can then be isolated in culture and tested in persistence and clinical trials. An effective mitigation strategy to ameliorate chytridiomycosis and other emerging infectious diseases is necessary; the advancement of omic methods and the integration of multiple omic data provide a promising avenue toward conservation of imperiled species."

A novel pathogen reduction process for platelets, the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system, has been developed and is under clinical evaluation for its efficacy and safety. In addition, proof of principle has been shown for UVC treatment of plasma units. The pathogen reduction process is based on application of UVC light of a specific wavelength (254 nm) combined with intense agitation of the blood units to ensure a uniform treatment of all blood compartments. Due to the different absorption characteristics of nucleic acids and proteins, UVC irradiation mainly affects the nucleic acid of pathogens and leukocytes while proteins are largely preserved. UVC treatment significantly reduces the infectivity of platelet units contaminated by disease-causing viruses and bacteria. In addition, it inactivates residual white blood cells in the blood components while preserving platelet function and coagulation factors. Since no photoactive compound needs to be added to the blood units, photoreagent-related adverse events are excluded. Because of its simple and rapid procedure without the need to change the established blood component preparation procedures, UVC-based pathogen inactivation could easily be implemented in existing blood banking procedures."

ZoonoticVL caused by L. in fanturn is a re-emergent canid zoonoses which represents a complex epidemiological cycle in the New world where domestic dogs serve as a reservoir host responsible for potentially fatal human infection and where dog culling is the only measure for reservoir control. Life-long immunity to VL has motivated development of prophylactic vaccines against the disease but very few have progressed beyond the experimental stage. No licensed vaccine is available till date against any form of leishmaniasis. High toxicity and increasing resistance to the current chemotherapeutic regimens have further complicated the situation in VL endemic regions of the world. Advances in vaccinology, including recombinant proteins, novel antigen-delivery systems/adjuvants, heterologous prime-boost regimens and strategies for intracellular antigen presentation, have contributed to recent advances in vaccine development againstVL. Attempts to develop an effective vaccine for use in domestic dogs in areas of canine VL should be pursued for preventing human infection. Studies in animal models and human patients have revealed the pathogenic mechanisms of disease progression and features of protective immunity. This review will summarize the accumulated knowledge of pathogenesis, immune response, and prerequisites for protective immunity against human VL. Authors will discuss promising vaccine candidates, their developmental status and future prospects in a quest for rational vaccine development against the disease. In addition, several challenges such as safety issues, renewed and coordinated commitment to basic research, preclinical studies and trial design will be addressed to overcome the problems faced in developing prophylactic strategies for protection against this lethal infection."

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe and frequently lethal protozoan disease of increasing incidence and severity due to infected human and dog migration, new geographical distribution of the insect due to global warming, coinfection with immunosuppressive diseases, and poverty. The disease is an anthroponosis in India and Central Africa and a canid zoonosis (ZVL) in the Americas, the Middle East, Central Asia, China, and the Mediterranean. The ZVL epidemic has been controlled by one or more measures including the culling of infected dogs, treatment of human cases, and insecticidal treatment of homes and dogs. However, the use of vaccines is considered the most cost effective control tool for human and canine disease. Since the severity of the disease is related to the generation of T-cell immunosuppression, effective vaccines should be capable of sustaining or enhancing the T-cell immunity. In this review we summarize the clinical and parasitological characteristics of ZVL with special focus on the cellular and humoral canine immune response and review state-of-the-art vaccine development against human and canine VL. Experimental vaccination against leishmaniasis has evolved from the practice of leishmanization with living parasites to vaccination with crude lysates, native parasite extracts to recombinant and DNA vaccination. Although more than 30 defined vaccines have been studied in laboratory models no human formulation has been licensed so far; however three second-generation canine vaccines have already been registered. As expected for a zoonotic disease, the recent preventive vaccination of dogs in Brazil has led to a reduction in the incidence of canine and human disease. The recent identification of several Leishmania proteins with T-cell epitopes anticipates development of a multiprotein vaccine that will be capable of protecting both humans and dogs against VL."

As a result, conventional approaches fail to produce field-ready vaccines before the EID has spread extensively. Lassa is a prototypical emerging infectious disease endemic to West Africa for which no successful vaccine is available. We established the VaxCelerate Consortium to address the need for more rapid vaccine development by creating a platform capable of generating and pre-clinically testing a new vaccine against specific pathogen targets in less than 120 d A self-assembling vaccine is at the core of the approach. It consists of a fusion protein composed of the immunostimulatory Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (MtbHSP70) and the biotin binding protein, avidin. Mixing the resulting protein (MAV) with biotinylated pathogen-specific immunogenic peptides yields a self-assembled vaccine (SAV). To meet the time constraint imposed on this project, we used a distributed R&D model involving experts in the fields of protein engineering and production, bioinformatics, peptide synthesis/design and GMP/GLP manufacturing and testing standards. SAV immunogenicity was first tested using H1N1 influenza specific peptides and the entire VaxCelerate process was then tested in a mock live-fire exercise targeting Lassa fever virus. We demonstrated that the Lassa fever vaccine induced significantly increased class II peptide specific interferon- CD4(+) T cell responses in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice compared to peptide or MAV alone controls. We thereby demonstrated that our SAV in combination with a distributed development model may facilitate accelerated regulatory review by using an identical design for each vaccine and by applying safety and efficacy assessment tools that are more relevant to human vaccine responses than current animal models."

For some of the pathogens prevalence data still need to be investigated in Germany. However, natural infections with Bartonella, Anaplasma, haemotropic Mycoplasma and Borrelia species have already been described in German cats. Clinical relevance of these pathogens is not fully understood, and it is still unknown, why most infected cats stay asymptomatic and which predisposing factors contribute to the development of clinical signs in cats. Moreover, there is a risk of zoonotic transmission for some of the pathogens, e.g., for some Bartonella spp. infections that are associated with cat scratch disease in humans.

A plethora of intrinsic biological and extrinsic factors affect the relationship among helminths, vectors and animal hosts, in a constantly changing environment. Although canine dirofilarioses by Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are key examples of the success of VBH spreading into non-endemic areas, another example is represented by Thelazia callipaeda eyeworm, an emergent pathogen of dogs, cats and humans in several regions of Europe. The recent finding of Onchocerca lupi causing canine and human infestation in Europe and overseas renders the picture of VBH even more complicated. Similarly, tick-transmitted filarioids of the genus Cercopithifilaria infesting the skin of dogs were recently shown to be widespread in Europe. Although for most of the VBH above there is an increasing accumulation of research data on their distribution at national level, the overall impact of the diseases they cause in dogs and humans is not fully recognised in many aspects.

Of the two distinct clinical syndromes, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) affects the skin and mucous membranes, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) affects internal organs. Approaches to prevent transmission include vector control by reducing human contact with infected sandflies, and reservoir control, by reducing the number of infected animals. Objectives To assess the effects of vector and reservoir control interventions for cutaneous and for visceral leishmaniasis. Search methods We searched the following databases to 13 January 2015: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and WHOLIS, Web of Science, and RePORTER. We also searched trials registers for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of vector and reservoir control interventions in leishmaniasis-endemic regions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently searched for trials and extracted data from included RCTs. We resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 14 RCTs that evaluated a range of interventions across different settings. The study methods were generally poorly described, and consequently all included trials were judged to be at high or unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. Only seven trials reported clinical outcome data which limits our ability to make broad generalizations to different epidemiological settings and cultures. Cutaneous leishmaniasis One four-arm RCT from Afghanistan compared indoor residual spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), and insecticide-treated bedsheets, with no intervention. Over 15 months follow-up, all three insecticide-based interventions had a lower incidence of CL than the control area (IRS: risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.97, 2892 participants, moderate quality evidence; ITNs: RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.56, 2954 participants, low quality evidence; ITS: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.57, 2784 participants, low quality evidence). No difference was detected between the three interventions (low quality evidence). One additional trial of ITNs from Iran was underpowered to show a difference. Insecticide treated curtains were compared with no intervention in one RCT from Venezuela, where there were no CL episodes in the intervention areas over 12 months follow-up compared to 142 in control areas (RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49, one trial, 2938 participants, low quality evidence). Personal protection using insecticide treated clothing was evaluated by two RCTs in soldiers, but the trials were underpowered to reliably detect effects on the incidence of CL (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.20, two trials, 558 participants, low quality evidence). Visceral leishmaniasis In a single RCT of ITNs versus no intervention from India and Nepal, the incidence of VL was low in both groups and no difference was detected (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.15, one trial, 19,810 participants, moderate quality evidence). Two trials from Brazil evaluated the effects of culling infected dogs compared to no intervention or IRS. Although they report a reduction in seroconversion over 18 months follow-up, they did not measure or report effects on clinical disease. Authors' conclusions Using insecticides to reduce phlebotomine sandfly numbers may be effective at reducing the incidence of CL, but there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether it is better to spray the internal walls of houses or to treat bednets, curtains, bedsheets or clothing."

Various authors have shown that Dermanyssoidea are implicated in the transmission of both bacteria (Salmonella, Spirocheta, Rickettsia or Posteurella and viruses (equine encephalitis viruses, West Nile virus, Fowl pox virus, the virus causing Newcastle disease and tick borne encephalitis viruses or hantaviruses). Finally, some authors have also shown their role in the transmission of some protozoa and filaria.

On one side, it is connected with the wellness of animals 'prevention and control of animal diseases' and on the other side it takes care of the health of humans professionally exposed to zoonotic infections. Farmers, animal products' processors, lab workers, epidemiologists, health workers, sylvan, camping and recreational groups constitute a large chunk of population that is served by VPHE professionals. They also provide a protective role to consumers from Farm to Fork. Reputation of a college depends upon the reputation of faculty and available infrastructure. Professors of VPHE and Deans of veterinary faculty are expected to be highly knowledgeable. They need to connect horizontally with public all stakeholders and in all such areas where veterinary services are required to address the problems. Such initiatives would benefit both. The expertise/services of veterinarians, especially VPHE personnel are not sufficiently utilized for want of a Government policy adopting ""One Health"", although advocated jointly by OIE, WHO, FAO and adopted by most countries.

It is advisable to sample a broad range of vertebrates and invertebrates at different temporospatial levels on a regular basis to detect possible candidate viruses at their natural source. However, virus surveillance systems can be expensive, costly in terms of finances and resources and inadequate for sampling sufficient numbers of different host species over space and time. Recent publications have presented the concept of a new virus surveillance system, coining the terms ""flying biological syringes"", ""xenosurveillance"" and ""vector-enabled metagenomics"". According to these novel and promising surveillance approaches, viral metagenomics on engorged mosquitoes might reflect the viral diversity of numerous mammals, birds and humans, combined in the mosquitoes' blood meal during feeding on the host. In this review article, we summarize the literature on vector-enabled metagenomics (VEM) techniques and its application in disease surveillance in humans. Furthermore, we highlight the combination of VEM and ""invertebrate-derived DNA"" (iDNA) analysis to identify the host DNA within the mosquito midgut."

It also causes devastating economic losses in livestock of developing countries due to reproductive failure (abortion and stillborn) and is a major hurdle in international trade. Brucella has the capability to induce chronic infection in animals due to lack of selective preventive measures and inefficient antimicrobial therapies, and difficulty in elimination. The virulence factors of Brucella are involved in intracellular survival and replication within mononuclear phagocytic cells, preferentially macrophages in the host. Furthermore, Brucella pathogen has developed a battery of mechanisms to evade and/or modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in their host. Also, the stealthy nature of Brucella can make it able to evade from pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune arm, which can lead to its escape from intracellular destruction and to eventually replicate within phagocytic cells. All these comprehension of Brucella can inhabit inside the phagocytes of infected host to promote their survival, persistence and multiplication. Therefore, the analysis of the interaction between pathogen and immune response is relatively new area of intense research. In this review, we discussed the pathogenesis of Brucella spp. mechanisms that permit intracellular survival, subvert autophagy process and evasion to host immune responses."

The development of transportation systems, such as air travel, has increased the risk of a global pandemic caused by emerging viruses. Agents causing novel infections are often zoonotic, crossing from the natural host into the human population. Hence, comprehensive surveillance of virus-infected animals as well as humans is required. However, the number of virus particles in clinical and environmental samples is usually very low. Thus, a method to concentrate the virus is sometimes required in order to enable detection. We recently reported that magnetic beads coated with an anionic polymer, poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride) can be used to facilitate the rapid and sensitive detection of viruses.

Most severe viral disease outbreaks occur in developing regions where health conditions are poor. With increased international travel and business, the possibility of eventually transmitting infectious viruses between different countries is increasing. The most effective approach in preventing viral diseases is vaccination. However, vaccines are not currently available for numerous viral diseases. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are engineered vaccine candidates that have been studied for decades. VLPs are constructed by viral protein expression in various expression systems that promote the selfassembly of proteins into structures resembling virus particles. VLPs have antigenicity similar to that of the native virus, but are non-infectious as they lack key viral genetic material. VLP vaccines have attracted considerable research interest because they offer several advantages over traditional vaccines. Studies have shown that VLP vaccines can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, which may offer effective antiviral protection. Here we review recent developments with VLP-based vaccines for several highly virulent emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. WNV is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle, whereas humans and horses are considered dead-end hosts. In human and horses, symptoms range from unapparent infection to mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis or death. WNV has a wide geographical range that includes portions of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia (Kunjin virus), and in North, Central and South America. Migratory birds are thought to be primarily responsible for virus dispersal, including reintroduction of WNV from endemic areas into regions that experience sporadic outbreaks (Fields Virology, 2001, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, 1043-1125). The occurrence of disease in humans and animals along with birds and mosquitoes surveillance for WNV activity demonstrates that the virus range has dramatically expanded including North, Central and South America as well as Europe and countries facing the Mediterranean Basin.

As large-scale, concentrated production methods have become the predominant model for animal husbandry, animal feeds have been modified to include ingredients ranging from rendered animals and animal waste to antibiotics and organoarsenicals. In this article we review current U.S. animal feeding practices and etiologic agents that have been detected in animal feed. Evidence that current feeding practices may lead to adverse human health impacts is also evaluated. DATA SOURCES: We reviewed published veterinary and human-health literature regarding animal feeding practices, etiologic agents present in feed, and human health effects along with proceedings from animal feed workshops. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from peer-reviewed articles and books identified using PubMed, Agricola, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases. DATA SYNTHESIS: Findings emphasize that current animal feeding practices can result in the presence of bacteria, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, prions, arsenicals, and dioxins in feed and animal-based food products. Despite a range of potential human health impacts that could ensue, there are significant data gaps that prevent comprehensive assessments of human health risks associated with animal feed. Limited data are collected at the federal or state level concerning the amounts of specific ingredients used in animal feed, and there are insufficient surveillance systems to monitor etiologic agents '' from farm to fork.'' CONCLUSIONS: Increased funding for integrated veterinary and human health surveillance systems and increased collaboration among feed professionals, animal producers, and veterinary and public health officials is necessary to effectively address these issues."

It was thought that the virus had been eradicated in Western Europe, but it re-emerged in Greece and Italy. Physicians should be aware of this diagnosis in the case of severe encephalitis. Some viruses (Powassan, Nipah, and Hendra) are becoming endemic in some new parts of the world (USA and Australia). Because of their severity, they are healthcare concerns in those countries and for travelers (e.g. in Asia).

Apart from the intrinsic features of viruses as plant pathogens, the highly dynamic turnover of cultivars and cultural practices, and the global trade of seeds and products characteristic of intensive vegetable production may favour the emergence of new viruses, as well as the expansion of the geographical range of vectors responsible for their dissemination. Indeed, the efficient transmission of viruses plays a major role in the impact and outcome of viral epidemics.

New molecular approaches hold potential to increase our understanding of parasite interactions within hosts. Also, advances in our knowledge of immune systems makes immunological parameters viable measures of parasite exposure, and useful tools for improving our understanding of causal mechanisms. 3. Studies of transmission dynamics have revealed the importance of heterogeneity in host behaviour and physiology, and of contact processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. An important future challenge is to determine the key transmission mechanisms maintaining the persistence of different types of diseases in the wild. 4. Regulation of host populations is too complex to consider parasite effects in isolation from other factors. One solution is to seek a unified understanding of the conditions under which (and the ecological rules determining when) population scale impacts of parasites can occur. 5. Good evidence now shows that both direct effects of parasites, and trait mediated indirect effects, frequently mediate the success of invasive species and their impacts on recipient communities. A wider exploration of these effects is now needed. 6. At the ecosystem scale, research is needed to characterize the circumstances and conditions under which both fluxes in parasite biomass, and trait mediated effects, are significant in ecosystem processes, and to demonstrate that parasites do indeed increase 'ecosystem health'. 7. There is a general need for more empirical testing of predictions and subsequent development of theory in the classic research cycle. Experimental field studies, meta-analyses, the collection and analysis of long-term data sets, and data constrained modelling, will all be key to advancing our understanding. 8. Finally, we are only now beginning to understand the importance of cross-scale interactions associated with parasitism. Such interactions may offer key insights into bigger picture questions such as when and how different regulatory factors are important, when disease can cause species extinctions, and what characteristics are indicative of functionally resilient ecosystems."

This article identifies requirements and challenges inherent in wildlife health investigations, reviews important definitions and novel health investigation methods, and proposes tools and strategies for effective wildlife health surveillance programs. Impediments to wildlife health investigations are largely related to zoological, behavioral and ecological characteristics of wildlife populations and to limited access to investigation materials. These concerns should not be viewed as insurmountable but it is imperative that they are considered in study design, data analysis and result interpretation. It is particularly crucial to remember that health surveillance does not begin in the laboratory but in the fields. In this context, participatory approaches and mutual respect are essential. Furthermore, interdisciplinarity and open minds are necessary because a wide range of tools and knowledge from different fields need to be integrated in wildlife health surveillance and research. The identification of factors contributing to disease emergence requires the comparison of health and ecological data over time and among geographical regions. Finally, there is a need for the development and validation of diagnostic tests for wildlife species and for data on free-ranging population densities. Training of health professionals in wildlife diseases should also be improved. Overall, the article particularly emphasizes five needs of wildlife health investigations: communication and collaboration; use of synergies and triangulation approaches; investments for the long term; systematic collection of meta-data; and harmonization of definitions and methods."

From this perspective, xenotransplantation clinical trials combine a potential benefit for individual recipients with a potential risk to the human community. However, the potential for benefit also extends beyond the individual recipient to society as a whole, a fact infrequently recognized in discussions of this topic. Further, diseases neither endemic in human communities nor recognized as classic zoonoses are introduced into humans periodically through routine interactions between human and nonhuman animals. Thus, xenotransplantation is one of multiple potential routes by which infectious agents of nonhuman origin may enter human ecosystems. The intentional and controlled nature of xenotransplantation exposures enables implementation of measures to minimize associated biohazards. Development of guidelines and implementation of regulatory oversight of xenotransplantation clinical trials in most nations where such research occurs has promoted a standard level of practice in the field and markedly reduced the risk of xenotransplant-introduced infection compared to the situation in 1995."

As XMRV research progressed, conflicting results emerged regarding the importance of this virus in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer and/or CFS. Molecular biologists traced the development of XMRV to a recombination event in a laboratory mouse that likely occurred circa 1993. The virus was propagated via cell lines derived from a tumor present in this mouse and spread through contamination of laboratory samples. Well-controlled experiments showed that detection of XMRV was due to contaminated samples and was not a marker of or a causal factor in prostate cancer or CFS.

Although most ZIKV infections are subclinical or characterized by mild febrile illness, ZIKV has been implicated in severe complications, most notably microcephaly in babies born to incident infected mothers during pregnancy. As yet, the extent to which ZIKV is transfusion transmissible remains undefined. Nonetheless, a high prevalence of asymptomatic infection during outbreaks, the demonstration of ZIKV in blood donors, and 4 possible cases of transfusion-transmitted ZIKV in Brazil have raised concern for risk to the blood supply. Consequently, a proactive response is underway by blood collection agencies, regulatory bodies, national funding agencies, and industry alike. Mitigation strategies differ between endemic and nonendemic areas. In the continental United States, the American Association of Blood Banks and Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend travel-based deferral for those returning from affected areas, and nucleic acid testing is being initiated under an investigational new drug application in Puerto Rico and selected areas of the United States. Options are less clear for countries where autochthonous vector-borne transmission is active. The burden of Zika falls in low-resource countries where high cost and technical barriers associated with testing and pathogen reduction pose barriers to implementation. Additional strategies include maintaining selective inventory for high-risk recipients (eg, pregnant women). We review the available data as of July 2016 on ZIKV in relation to the blood supply including risk, mitigation strategies, and barriers to implementation in addition to the research that is needed to address current uncertainty.

There are no licensed medical countermeasures (vaccines, therapies or preventive drugs) available for Zika virus infection and disease. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) predicts that Zika virus will continue to spread and eventually reach all countries and territories in the Americas with endemic Aedes mosquitoes. This paper reviews the status of the Zika virus outbreak, including medical countermeasure options, with a focus on how the epidemiology, insect vectors, neuropathology, virology and immunology inform options and strategies available for medical countermeasure development and deployment. Methods Multiple information sources were employed to support the review. These included publically available literature, patents, official communications, English and Lusophone lay press. Online surveys were distributed to physicians in the US, Mexico and Argentina and responses analyzed. Computational epitope analysis as well as infectious disease outbreak modeling and forecasting were implemented. Field observations in Brazil were compiled and interviews conducted with public health officials."

Worldwide, zoonotic diseases have a negative impact on commerce, travel and economies. To survive, a biological pathogen had to be a chronic infection, stay alive in the host for long periods of time, or have a non-human reservoir or waiting for new hosts to infect. For zoonozes, often human is actually an accidental victim and a dead-end host. In recent years, zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man and animals have gained increasing attention worldwide. Human diseases that have their origins in infected animals, such as Bird Flu or tuberculosis, have highlighted the need for a better understanding of animal diseases in terms of their epidemiology, mechanism of transmission to man, diagnosis, prevention and control. In addition, as yet unidentified zoonotic diseases probably exist that pose infectious risks for people. This paper is an effort to develop a tentative inventory of the most common zoonotic diseases for sensitization of the personnel having frequent contact with animals."

While laboratory animals are monitored for pathogenic agents, the hygienic status of pet animals is usually completely unknown. Despite great efforts, zoonotic infections were reported even in laboratory settings, e. g. with Hantavirus (Seoul virus), Streptobacillus moniliformis, and Trichphyton mentagrophytes. However, in current reports, zoonotic infections were transmitted by mice and rats maintained as pet animals. This includes infections by Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Leptospira interrogans, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Salmonella enterica, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Ornithonyssus bacoti. Furthermore, entero-hepatic Helicobacter spp. of rats and mice are currently discussed to be involved in the etiology of hepatobiliary diseases. Pasteurella spp. of mice and rats do not present a risk for human disease comparable to those species that are transmitted by dogs or cats and might induce serious disease after bites. Altogether, this article lists potential zoonotic agents that were detected in mice and rats and are present in Germany, as well as agents that were reportedly transmitted by mice and rats maintained as laboratory or pet rodents."

Global warming, unrestricted exploitation of natural resources such as forests and fisheries, urbanization, human migration, and industrialization of animal husbandry cause environmental destruction and fragmentation. These changes of the biosphere favor local emergence of zoonoses from their natural biotopes and their interaction with domestic animals and human populations. Subsequently, international commerce, human and animal migration and travel, favor the dissemination of these zoonotic pathogens worldwide. Chile is undergoing an important degradation of many wild-life biotopes, affecting their diversity and contributing to the dissemination of zoonoses such as Chagas disease, Hantavirus, rabies, fish tapeworms, and marine vibriosis. Moreover agents of many other zoonoses such as leptospirosis, hydatidosis, salmonellosis, rabies, brucellosis and anthrax have been detected in different wild-life environments in the country. The intensification and accelerations of the anthropogenic deterioration of the biosphere in Chile, as results of the unrestricted utilization of natural resources and global climate change, suggests that emergence of new zoonoses in the near future will lead to important public health and economic problems. Forestalling of these problems will require active epidemiological surveillance of wild and domestic animals with a wide range of modern molecular and ancillary epidemiological tools. This also demands government and private sector (i.e., animal husbandry) intervention, funding and the collaboration of professionals in human and veterinary medicine with those in the envirommental sciences including ecology, climatology and oceanography."

As a result, climate change impacts are more pronounced here than in other regions of the United States. Warmer temperatures may allow some infected host animals to survive winters in larger numbers, increase their population and expand their range of habitation thus increasing the opportunity for transmission of infection to humans. Subsistence hunting and gathering activities may place rural residents of Alaska at a greater risk of acquiring zoonotic infections than urban residents. Known zoonotic diseases that occur in Alaska include brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, giardiasis/cryptosporidiosis, echinococcosis, rabies and tularemia. Actions for early disease detection, research and prevention and control include: (1) determining baseline levels of infection and disease in both humans and host animals; (2) conducting more research to understand the ecology of infection in the Arctic environment; (3) improving active and passive surveillance systems for infection and disease in humans and animals; (4) improving outreach, education and communication on climate-sensitive infectious diseases at the community, health and animal care provider levels; and (5) improving coordination between public health and animal health agencies, universities and tribal health organisations."

Emphases over the years on causal organisms have been on bacteria and viruses. However, with the emergence of zoonotic parasites, it is important to consider the wildlife reservoir and the spectrum of their zoonotic parasites. Human activities have increased contact with game, thus humans serve either as intermediate, reservoir or accidental host in the sylvatic cycle. The epidemiological information of these zoonotic wildlife parasites are scanty due to poor surveillance strategies in Africa, therefore prevalence studies are necessary to develop control measures and to conduct consequence assessments in cases of outbreaks. This review emphasizes the role that wildlife plays in spreading zoonotic parasites to other animals and humans and the consequences in Africa. It summarizes the present knowledge about the prevalence and spectrum of zoonotic parasites of wildlife and the human population at risk in Africa. It also gives insight into the dynamics of zoonotic parasites of wildlife. It will also increase our risk perception of zoonotic diseases and help to formulate effective control measures in Africa."

However, ethical and technical challenges have hampered the identification of novel blood-borne pathogens in these animals. We recently examined RNA viruses in plasma from wild African monkeys and discovered several novel, highly divergent viruses belonging to the family Arteriviridae. Close relatives of these viruses, including simian hemorrhagic fever virus, have caused sporadic outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in captive macaque monkeys since the 1960s. However, arterivirus infection in wild nonhuman primates had not been described prior to 2011. The arteriviruses recently identified in wild monkeys have high sequence and host species diversity, maintain high viremia, and are prevalent in affected populations. Taken together, these features suggest that the simian arteriviruses may be ""preemergent"" zoonotic pathogens. If not, this would imply that biological characteristics of RNA viruses thought to facilitate zoonotic transmission may not, by themselves, be sufficient for such transmission to occur."

The program culminated with the obliteration of the disease, one of the most important achievements in modern medicine. Interestingly, one of the key factors in the successful vaccination campaign - the VACV itself - is poorly understood in relation to its natural reservoirs, evolutionary history and origins, being frequently considered extinct as a naturally occurring virus. Nevertheless, orthopoxviruses other than variola virus have been known to circulate in Brazil since the early 1960s. More specifically, VACV has been associated with naturally acquired infections in humans, cattle and possibly other reservoirs since 1999, when bovine vaccinia outbreaks started to be consistently described year after year. In this article, we list and discuss the most important VACV outbreaks that have occurred in Brazil in the last 20 years. Phylogenetic issues are considered, as the latest studies point to large genetic variance among isolates. Clinical and epidemiological data, both published and new, are presented."

In addition, with increasing contacts between humans and the wildlife and the domestic fauna, the emergence and reemergence of zoonotic viruses is accelerating. The development and democratization of high-throughput sequencing tools and their application in metagenomics allow inventorying the viral communities of various reservoirs and vectors in order to detect the emergence of viruses before their transmission to humans. The prediction of future emerging zoonotic viruses is very difficult, if not impossible. However, the characterization of viral communities present in the different actors of zoonotic transmission cycle is a first step to evaluate potential risks of transmission to humans. In this article, we report a brief summary of the concepts of emergence and zoonoses before reviewing the current tools available to monitor their emergence."
