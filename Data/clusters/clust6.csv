"The volume of consumption of wildlife products for food is at least an order of magnitude lower than it is for domestic livestock. However, human being–animal contact associated with hunting, preparation, and consumption of wild animals has led to transmission of notable diseases."
"Human contact with wildlife is increased on a large scale through road building, establishment of settlements, and increased mobility of people, and the extractive process itself. Where these changes take place, hunting, consumption, and trade in wildlife for food often increases."
"It has been thought that a zoonotic virus can be transmitted from animals to food handlers who handle, kill, or butcher animals. Direct contact of humans with animal blood, bodily fluids, or excreta during food handling appears to be the simplest and most plausible explanation for the cross-species transmission of viruses."
"customs, traditions, cultural and religious beliefs all have significant impact on the choice and preparation of food and consequently the potential exposure to foodborne parasitic agents... An increasing number of consumers is now searching for exotic products...At the same time, there is an increasing interest for healthy and ready-to-eat products, such as ready-to-eat salads. Soft fruit and salad vegetables increase both the likelihood of surface contamination and the survival of the infective stages of parasites pathogenic to man...Fish meat may indeed be the vehicle for different parasite species, and the new dietary habits linked to the higher demand for fish in many countries, in particular for saltwater fish, have favoured the exposure to fishborne parasites...the increased consumption of raw vegetables and undercooking to retain the natural taste and preserve heat-labile nutrients and vitamins may be linked to increased risk of foodborne transmission of zoonoses...The consumption of “unusual” animal species is also an increasing trend possibly linked to foodborne parasitic infection."
"Hunting and other outdoor activities may also be an exposure factor to eating inadequately cooked game...during or after hunting and shooting expeditions"
"Bushmeat serves as a very significant source of EIDs...hunting wild animals (particularly primates) for consumption carries with it certain risks of pathogen transmission...Hunting these animals is associated with the risk of biting, and accidental cutting can happen during meat preparation"
"Eating small animals, no doubt incompletely cooked, expanded the diversity of parasitism in two ways; exposure to parasites by direct ingestion of the vertebrate host and exposure of humans to vectors of the parasite"
"Since prehistoric time, major changes in human disease burden, spatial distribution, and pathogen types have arisen largely owing to human activity. The change from small hunter-gatherer to large agricultural communities was associated with the emergence of human contagious diseases, many of which are of animal origin."
"Bushmeat (primate meat and brain) is a multibillion dollar business with huge urban demand. The demand is recently being easily met due to facilitated access to primate habitats by logging roads in Africa"
"Establishment of animal conservation and rehabilitation centres, national parks and wildlife reserves, which is facilitated by new access roads, increases the association between humans and animals, as do zoos, aquaria and seaworlds, industrial animal production, nontraditional agriculture, aquaculture, free-ranging/farmed game species and hunting"
"Exposure to the culinary customs of developing countries (or rural regions of the developed world) often results in exposure to typical and non-typical (such as Brucella) foodborne pathogens. Culinary practices that have emerged as fashionable in recent years, e.g. raw fish or even bushmeat consumption, have led to exposure of unsuspecting connoisseurs to unusual infectious bacteria and parasites"
"Risk factors for emergence, in addition to being a market worker as suggested by the completed study, might also include being a hunter of wild animals, being a restaurant worker who kills and or butchers/prepares wild animal meat for consumption, or being a member of a household who buys live or recently killed wild game meat from a wet market"
"Emergence may occur among humans living and working in small rural farming communities carved out of tropical rain forests, savannah, mountains, and desert that are in close proximity to wild animals, or to domestic animals they tend that have been in close proximity to wild animals...Emergence may occur in larger urban communities where human contact with animals is limited to a few farm animals in close proximity to households, to domestic pets, or to rodents and other animals that have adapted to the urban environment...Risk factors of emergence in these settings are lacking or inadequate community planning, lack of understanding by populations about risks associated with animal contact, failure to adopt and adhere to safe farming and slaughter/food processing and preparation practices, and failure to maintain sanitation and water infrastructure"
"Encroachment into natural habitats may bring humans into new contact with pathogens"
"The broad range of tissue and fluid exposures associated with the bushmeat industry’s hunting and butchering may make these wildlife interactions especially risky"
"A second exposure route results from direct incursions of people into wildlife habitat. Bushmeat hunting—which leads to handling, slaughtering, and consuming wild animal species—is such an incursion."
"A vast range of familiar human pathogens can be acquired through the consumption of animal products...In addition to farmed animals, the hunting and slaughtering of wild animals has led to the emergence of more exotic pathogens"
"The transition of Homo spp. omnivorous diet from predominantly herbivorous toward strongly carnivorous shaped it toward a predator–prey interface. Such an interface resulted in the acquisition of pathogens of prey, including pathogens specialized in using predator–prey relationships for transmission, such as helminths, and eventually led to the establishment and evolution of novel human pathogens."
"Bush meat consumption is an ancient and primordial practice and resource in tropical and developing countries...This facet of the modern human–animal interface, directly bringing in contact growing human populations with wild animal species and their products, is also a major factor in the continued and increasingly more frequent emergence of zoonotic pathogens faced by human society up to this day"
"The practice of eating raw or improperly cooked food including crustaceans, meat and fish has been a source of infection for many parasitic zoonoses in different cultures where this is practiced....In recent decades, the custom of eating foods raw, or only partially cooked, has grown worldwide and has led to the emergence of parasitic zoonoses in ethnic groups where eating raw or undercooked ‘meat’ was not previously common."
"The tradition of eating raw fish is becoming increasingly fashionable in many countries, principally with foods such as sushi, sashimi, koi-pla, kinilaw and ceviche. This has led to a dramatic rise in the incidence of a large number of fish borne zoonotic parasitic infections in previously uninfected ethnic groups."
"the increased movement of human populations into uninhabited regions, where they come into contact with a large and novel diversity of wildlife (that is, following deforestation in the tropics and increased bushmeat hunting"
"The more than one billion people worldwide who work on a daily basis with food animals or their products are at particularly high risk. These workers include farmers, abattoir workers, and market workers. Risks to such workers include injury, allergic exposures, exposures to organic dusts, and chemicals from confinement operations as well as infection...Often, being a less organized workforce compared with industrial workers, animal workers do not have access to preventive occupational safety and health programs or personal protective equipment when they perform tasks that may involve intense exposures to blood and body fluids and other animal materials"
"As human development encroaches on wildlife habitats, and humans continue to make contact with wildlife through hunting or trade in wild animals, there is increased risk of pathogen spillover into human populations. One example is the extensive bush meat trade, which involves hunters entering wildlife habitats to catch and butcher a large number of wildlife species to sell in low-biosecurity markets and/or for home consumption. This practice can expose the hunters and their community contacts to a range of viral and bacterial pathogens from nonhuman primates and other species."
"Food preparation and diet creates multiple opportunities for ZEP exposure, particularly among nomadic communities. As a primary source of nutrition through meat, milk and even blood products, animals serve as a lifeline to the dietary needs of many pastoralist societies. However, the consumption of raw or undercooked meat and organs or unprocessed milk and blood was noted as potential vehicles for ZEP transmission among nomadic groups from the included studies of this review. Pastoralists and nomads who also eat raw or undercooked snails, fish, reptiles, or amphibians or those who consume insects such as ants either intentionally or unintentionally are at risk for infection with multiple ZEPS as well."
"Wildlife share the same space as the pastoral communities in many regions and due to their bounty and diversity, ZEPs are provided multiples opportunities for intermediate and definitive host species for which to proliferate. Some nomadic communities also hunt wildlife leading to more exposure threats for ZEP transmission to humans."
"Aside from eating or drinking contaminated food items, preparation methods prior to consumption can also expose nomadic and pastoralist households to ZEPs. Home slaughter of livestock, wildlife, small rodents, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians have the potential to introduce zoonotic parasites from the infected exterior and interiors of the animals through accidental ingestion or inhalation during the butchering process...Unwashed vegetables and fruits were also noted as an exposure threat for participating nomadic communities"
"hunting, herding livestock to water and seasonal pastoral lands, and slaughter tend to be male-dominated. These activities take men away from the home and into the larger environment, where ZEPs in environmental water sources and wildlife may dominate."
"Thus, some helminths are transmitted to humans with meat, while others are transmitted on vegetables or fruits. In both cases human infection occurs by eating infected or contaminated meat or plant material that has been improperly cooked or washed."
"Helminth infections in wild animals, which may normally have limited human contact, can be introduced to domestic animals which do have contact with humans. This leads to the increased potential of human helminth infections which were once generally considered diseases of wildlife only. Hunting and consumption of wild animals, such as boar, are another mode of FBH infection in humans."
"Employment is one way in which humans are confronted with tick-infested habitats, often on a regular and/or frequent basis. Rangers, hunters or lumberjacks, for whom the forest is the designated place of work, are among the highest-risk occupations for contracting TBDs...Besides encountering tick-infested habitats on a professional basis, domestic activities such as walking the dog or collecting firewood in tick habitat are regarded as sources of increased exposure to ticks in their natural habitat...Leisure activities such as fishing, jogging or hiking that typically take place in natural tick habitats have also been identified as risk factors for infection"
"Contact between donor and recipient hosts is a precondition for virus transfer and is therefore affected by the geographical, ecological, and behavioral separation of the donor and recipient hosts. Factors that affect the geographical distribution of host species (e.g., wildlife trade and the introduction of domestic species) or that decrease their behavioral separation (e.g., bush meat hunting) tend to promote viral emergence"
"Viruses in these groups have co-evolved with specific rodent species whose contact with humans has increased as a result of modern environmental and human behavioural factors. Farming, keeping domestic pets, hunting and camping, deforestation and other types of habitat destruction all create new opportunities for such infectious agents to invade human hosts."
"The human invasion into formerly untouched areas through hunters, villagers, miners, forest product gatherers and tourists, among others, leads to intensified contacts with free-living animals."
"Human behavior and demographic factors can also influence the epidemiology of zoonoses with a wildlife reservoir. Hiking, camping, and hunting are activities that may represent risk factors for acquiring certain zoonoses with a wildlife reservoir, ..."
"In tropical forests, the building of roads to support logging or mining operations, or to connect villages and towns provides access to wildlife and is often associated with increased demand for, and access to, bushmeat. ... With the expansion of human populations, there has been an increase in demand for bushmeat, particularly in locations where alternative sources of protein have been scarce. It is therefore likely that the risk of future disease emergence through this process will also increase. "
"Humans have been in contact with infectious animals since prehistory but their exposure accelerated with the development of livestock husbandry beginning about 15,000 years ago. The growing global population has not only increased the demand for domesticated meat in the 21st C but has increased encroachment on areas once wild, both are trends that increase human exposure to animals and animal products"
"It is now generally accepted that the hunting and butchering of wild nonhuman primates in the early 20th century led to the introduction of simian immunodeficiency virus into the human population, giving rise to our modern day HIV pandemic. In our own work, we have demonstrated that the traditional practice of hunting and butchering nonhuman primates continues to be a gateway for the zoonotic transmission of retroviruses. For instance, among central Africans reporting contact with nonhuman primate blood and body fluids through hunting, butchering, and keeping primate pets, we identified a wide array of primate T lymphotropic viruses, including 2 novel viruses: one that is distinct from all other known primate T-lymphotropic viruses, now designated human T lymphotropic virus subtype 4 (HTLV-4), and a second that is similar to other nonhuman primate T lymphotropic virus subtype 3 viruses that had not previously been described as infecting humans. These results demonstrate that entry of pathogens into the human population via contact with nonhuman primates is an ongoing, dynamic process. In fact, zoonotic transmission of viruses occurs on an astonishingly regular basis. In a serological survey of >1000 rural Cameroonian villagers with reported exposure to primates, we found that 1% had antibodies to simian foamy virus, suggesting that populations exposed to animal reservoirs of disease are constantly assailed by zoonotic agents. "
"Zoonotic pathogens from wildlife may infect humans with little or no human-to-human transmission (e.g., avian influenza virus and Hendra virus). Alternatively, increased travel or migration and increased between-person contacts have facilitated emergence of simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV/AIDS in Africa. Increased exposure to wild-caught animals and high mutation rates of many RNA viruses have increased their predominance among emerging zoonoses transmitted from human to human; RNA viruses from bush meat may therefore play a possible role in future disease emergence."
"We are at risk for airborne transmission of zoonoses by many factors (e.g., from travel to farms, consumption of food, and mowing the lawn, which as been associated with tularemia). Visiting petting farms or having family pets increases the likelihood of potential zoonotic infections, especially if pets are exotic. Water sports may increase the risk for acquiring leptospirosis. Wilderness camping activities have been associated with hantavirus infection after inhalation of aerosolized urine excretions of rodents. Other sporting activities such as hunting have been associated with brucellosis and tularemia. Travel to other countries opens a range of new potential zoonotic exposures through direct contact or indirectly through fomites, food, or arthropod vectors. Increasingly exotic locations are being sought with associated exotic zoonoses. Some tourists consume local delicacies, such as aborted animal fetuses in Ecuador, which are a source of brucellosis."
"For example, increased bushmeat consumption is cited as a risk factor for the emergence of several zoonoses and novel pathogens, and could be caused by an increase in the number of hunters/consumers ... and/or increased contact between hunters/consumers and wildlife reservoirs."
