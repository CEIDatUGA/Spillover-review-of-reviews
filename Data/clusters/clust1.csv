"Transmission of pathogens into human populations from other species is a natural product of our relation with animals and the environment. The emergence of zoonoses, both recent and historical, can be considered as a logical consequence of pathogen ecology and evolution, as microbes exploit new niches and adapt to new hosts. The underlying causes that create or provide access to these new niches seem to be mediated by human action in most cases, and include changes in land use, extraction of natural resources, animal production systems, modern transportation, anti microbial drug use, and global trade. Although under lying ecological principles that shape how these pathogens survive and change have remained similar, people have changed the environment in which these principles operate."
"Environmental changes (including anthropogenic effects) might change the abundance of a wildlife reservoir host, increasing transmission within the reservoir and the risk of zoonotic transmission."
"In tropical regions, changes in land use have been linked to the occurrence of Chagas disease, yellow fever, and leishmaniasis. Such changes are particularly intense in tropical regions where primary forest is opened up to mining, logging, plantation development, and oil and gas extraction. This deforestation poses a threat to global health because many of these regions are emerging disease hotspots—rich in wildlife biodiversity and probably rich in the diversity of microbes, many of which have not yet been encountered by people. Increased access to tropical forests for these extractive industries might increase the risk of zoonotic disease by changing habitat and vector community composition, modifying the distribution of wildlife populations and domestic animals, and increasing exposure to pathogens through increased human contact with animals."
"the domestic wholesale and retail poultry markets provide the opportunity for the spread of viruses directly to humans"
"Logging, dam construction, mining, and oil/gas exploitation are also direct causes of deforestation. Expanding human habitation in a region may put people in direct contact with new animal species and thus their viruses"
"Visits to agricultural fairs, open farms, farmers’ markets, petting zoos, and other temporary animal exhibits present additional opportunities of zoonotic disease transmission"
"Among the fastest reproducing mammals, field voles can have over 15 broods per year, each with an average of six pups. This in turn considerably increases the risk of human exposure to any pathogens they may carry as well as stimulating such pathogens to undergo mutational adaptations to the changing ecosystems. "
"Rodents thrive on contaminated food and water, and are excellent swimmers. That rodents constitute an important part of the Earth’s biomass is manifested by estimates of rodents consuming at least a fifth of the world’s output of grain."
"There is a tight relationship between virus and its native rodent host, with each rodent species being infected with a single virus. Outbreaks of human disease are thus intimately related to the geographical distribution of the host reservoir."
"Abnormal weather patterns and increased rainfall results in a dramatic increase in the vegetation providing food for rodents. Thus the environment is able to suddenly sustain a rapidly expanding number of animals. As population sizes explode, the chances of rodents encroaching into peridomestic areas and households also increases, especially when the over abundance of food comes to an end. As a consequence there is a rise in the incidence of human illness as individuals have a much greater chance of coming into contact with excreta from persistently infected animals."
"The chance of virus switching into other rodent species also becomes a greater possibility as rodent territories expand and overlap."
"Given the increasing evidence of bats as reservoirs of emerging infections, it is worth considering the evolution and diversity of these mammals. Nearly 1000 species are distributed throughout the world, with the majority in areas close to the equator where food sources are most abundant. Belonging to the mammalian order Chiroptera, bats are broadly divisible into the Old World fruit-eating bats (180 species, suborder Megachiroptera) and the microbats—some 800 species grouped into 17 families within the suborder Microchiroptera. Insectivorous bats are all microbats. Bats evolved around 50 million years ago, with the fruit bats evolving along a very different path to the insect-eating species. Bats are found in most terrestrial habitats, with species distribution varying widely, some being restricted to a single island, others being found across continents. "
"Fruit-eating bats are not normally cave dwelling, normally forming roosts in tree-tops or crevices in decaying trees and thus present opportunities for spread to humans. Many bats travel long distances for food, especially fruit-eating species who respond to ever varying supply of food and who must compete with birds and other animals. Flights covering distances of 1.5–2.0 miles from the roost is the norm, although some species will forage over a distance of 30 miles in a single night. While both insectivorous and fruit eating bats have been shown to harbor zoonotic viruses, fruit-eating bats represent the biggest risk for human contact: most of the flesh of fruit is discarded from the mouth of feeding animals, thus providing ample opportunity for virus spread."
"Mechanistically, virus emergence is a three-step process. In the first step, a virus acquires the ability to infect new host cells. The second step consists of virus adaption to the novel host such that transmission between hosts is facilitated. Finally, to achieve full emergence, the virus gains the ability to spread epidemically through the host population. While the first two steps entail genetic changes in the virus, the third step may require changes on the part of the vector or host populations, such as through increased contact rates, range changes, or other ecological or environmental shifts. Virus emergence is, therefore, by definition, an eco-evolutionary process."
"Anthropogenic modifications of land use can also facilitate novel species associations, allowing a parasite to infect a novel host. Parasites associated with agriculture and animal husbandry can spill over into wild species as well as humans. Domestic hosts can also serve as ‘stepping stones’ for parasites, which can move from wild to domestic species. Often, the stepping stones act ecologically (increasing parasite population sizes and/or transmission opportunities), allowing a parasite to move into a new species without evolutionary change. However, these systems also make it more likely that a genetic mutation will arise in the parasite that will allow it to successfully spill over into a novel host"
"One mechanism driving the association between host density and disease outbreaks is the evolution of increased parasite virulence. Parasite virulence is often correlated with transmission ability, as parasites that co-opt more host resources produce more transmission stages and are also more virulent. Theory predicts that when parasite virulence and transmission rate are low, an increase in these traits can increase the likelihood of infecting additional hosts (i.e. it can increase parasite fitness); however, at very high levels of virulence, earlier host death may limit transmission. When host population densities increase, this reduces the cost of earlier host mortality, selecting for parasites that are more virulent than might have been otherwise supported."
"concentrated resources influence host migration into urban landscapes and therefore increase species contact rates, including contact between humans and wildlife hosts"
"contact rates between zoonotic hosts, humans, and vectors can respond to changes in landscape or climate...Changes in contact rates that accompany environmental changes can occur both within and between populations...changes in landscape and climate can affect contact rates between developmental stages of pathogen life cycles and hosts (zoonotic or humans); for instance, environmental stressors can change longevity or movement patterns of environmental stages of vectors or hosts and thereby affect contact rates"
"Anthropogenic changes to landscapes, from fragmentation of previously continuous habitats to creation of reserves, can concentrate animal populations in small areas at unnaturally high densities. Because host density is a key driver of transmission rates, these changes may create new foci of transmission or novel sources of zoonotic infections because reserves may also attract human visitors."
"Similarly, changes in food or other key resources, without changes to the habitat itself, can promote clumping of hosts and create foci of intra- or interspecific parasite transmission"
"changing risk of transmission of zoonoses when human behaviour causes habitat change, such as forest clearing, which may also increase probability of exposure to vectors or hosts"
"industrialization, the development of megacities and generalized urbanization...have led to a continuous encroachment of humans into previously uninhabited areas: this not only affects the ecology of wildlife habitats, unleashing dynamics that allow for zoonotic pathogen or vector predominance...but also directly brings essentially ‘virgin’ human populations into contact with a novel environment (including its zoonotic agents)"
"The industrialization of animal production may lead not only to greater animal-to-animal contact, but increasing animal-to-human contact, particularly when production facilities border urban areas...intensive livestock operations are moving closer to major urban areas in countries such as Bangladesh. This nexus, described as the “peri-urbanization” of industrial animal agriculture, may provide “flash points” for the source of new diseases."
"today’s warmer winters tend to increase the rodent populations in the summer, leading to increased contact with humans"
"Poor quality housing, which does not provide an effective barrier to mosquitoes, rodents, or fleas, further contributes to the spread of vector-borne disease in slums"
"Domestication of plants and animals, associated with the processing and storage of food, prompted close and sustained interactions between humans, live animal species and their products, as well as demographic booms in both domesticated animals and commensal species. Husbandry practices generated crowded conditions for domestic livestock, facilitating the emergence, spread, and evolution of infectious pathogens within these species. Agricultural practices opened rich ecological niches for today’s commensals, such as several rodent species, spurring likewise unprecedented demographic growth of pest species, their association with humans and unmatched fertile soils for their pathogens. Cross-species transmission of zoonoses to humans leading the way to eventual establishment and evolution of new human pathogens represents a small but crucial step across the domesticated human–animal interface"
"zoonotic diseases mainly associated with insect or rodent vectors...Precarious and poor sanitary conditions associated with the massive movements of humans along trade and conquest roads would drive the surge of these zoonotic pathogens. On the one hand, novel exposures of both colonists and indigenous residents to novel pathogens would follow the colonization and invasion of new territories; on the other hand, the vector or reservoir hosts of these new infections would be carried along and introduced into new regions and across continents."
"growing urbanization worldwide infringes on natural habitats and creates favorable conditions for commensal species, providing shelters and ample food resources to sustain their ever-growing populations. Urban and periurban environments are colonized by opportunistic mammalian and bird species, favoring the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens"
"domestic animal herds would have served as conduits for pathogen spillover between humans and local wildlife populations. The first human settlements also provided new ecological niches and specialized habitats for reservoir hosts, including many rodent and vector species such as rats, mice, mosquitoes, and fleas. Reservoirs can enable a pathogen to persist even in the absence of a susceptible human population large enough to sustain the pathogen by itself. Regular contact between humans and these novel hosts facilitated the emergence of new zoonoses"
"the increased trade and transport of wildlife and domesticated animals over vast distances on a sizeable scale that continues to escalate (that is, for food, pet trade, zoos, and research). The comingling of humans and animals, at both regional and global scales, creates numerous opportunities for pathogens to spread between host groups that had only minimal contact in the ancestral environment"
"The scenarios proposed for global climate change, including extreme weather events, strongly suggest impacts on infectious disease, including those associated with zoonotic parasites...For zoonotic parasites of wildlife, altered development and mortality rates of life-cycle stages affected by environmental conditions, and changes in vector ecology, including contact rates with human and animal hosts, are among the more obvious possible impacts."
"heightened viral shedding and concomitant spillover events have been linked to bat reproduction for both henipaviruses and filoviruses"
"Changes in human ecology, particularly patterns of land use and interactions with animal reservoirs, are likely to change our exposure to potential new pathogens, as are changes in the ecology of the pathogens, their reservoirs or their vectors, e.g., as a result of climate change or other kinds of environmental change."
"Housing type and structure may also play a part in the transmission of ZEPs to pastoral groups as animals and vectors can enter freely and exposure people, food, drinking water, and the home environment to parasites"
"wild animals are increasingly found in urban environments bringing closer contact between wildlife and humans, which gives rise to a number of wildlife maintained parasitic infections in humans and domestic animals. Raccoons and the red fox are important examples of wildlife hosts that exist in urban environments. Helminths of wildlife crossing to domestic animals, which live in close contact with humans, is another mechanism whereby a zoonosis can spread."
"Rats are often found in peridomestic and domestic areas in urban and rural areas where they come into close contact with humans and can carry a number of zoonotic helminths."
"There have been reports of a number of exotic zoonotic helminths present in nonendemic countries in zoo animals, or in illegally imported animals coming from endemics areas. While most zoo animals are kept separately from wild animals in the new country, animals such as rats and birds may interact with these animals."
"Rodents are another group of animals that have adapted well to urban environments. The black rat, Rattus rattus, has an almost global distribution due to human movement around the world, and it may be responsible for the introduction of new species of zoonotic helminth to previously nonendemic areas"
"Increasing habitat destruction and human encroachment on natural areas has led to an increase in the contact of wild animals with humans and also with companion animals. Animals such as raccoons and skunks are known pests in North America and are often found in cities living off household rubbish...It is inevitable that as wild habitats are destroyed and global warming impacts on food sources that transmission of wildlife zoonosis to humans will increase."
"Importantly, humans directly involved in land-use change activities (e.g. deforestation, dam construction, agriculture and mining) generally have higher contact with wildlife and often engage in behaviours that increase their risk of exposure to zoonotic diseases"
"Exposure to ticks, paradoxically, might be higher in people of high and low income than in those with intermediate income...Generally, outdoor recreational opportunities associated with wealth can result in increased exposure to vectors. Conversely, hardship precipitated by population displacements due to civil conflict, loss of protective housing through natural disasters, or use of natural environmental resources driven by economic transitions can lead to increased contact between people and vectors."
"Changing geographic distributions generate new footprints for hosts and their parasites and sometimes generate new sympatries for individuals and species. As a result, parasites might switch between established and newly arrived hosts and/or host species, and first-time exposure of hosts in the absence of specific immunity might result in deleterious health impacts. In addition, immigration or emigration of hosts and/or host species not susceptible to a parasite can influence parasite transmission."
"Populations of urban-adapted hosts can reach densities in urban and suburban areas that are much higher than observed in undisturbed areas. Moreover, an abundance of certain resources is available in the city areas throughout the year via human waste or intentional feeding by citizens. These can additionally support thriving urban-adapted animal populations and can lead to increased contact with humans."
"It is not only the landscape but also the mean temperature in urban environments that differs from the surrounding areas, being between 1 and 6.5 C higher on warm days. This heat island effect is presumably caused by heat absorption from dark surfaces in built-up areas and its subsequent re-radiation as thermal infrared radiation, together with the lack of vegetation. This temperature pattern might influence the survival, activity and distribution of ticks in cities, with a possible impact on reproductive success, the period of tick activity both from a daily and an annual perspective, and thus have an effect on pathogen prevalences."
"As cities expand, human populations encroach upon their rural, peri-urban and suburban surroundings, invading natural and seminatural environments such as forests and former agricultural land. This urban sprawl can lead to an increased exposition of humans to vector ticks and TBPs due to the general increase of contact zones between wildlife and humans or domestic animals. Even though urbanization decreases the abundance and diversity of wildlife parasites, pathogen transmission can increase among urban-adapted hosts, resulting in the emergence of urban zoonotic disease cycles and the spread of infectious agents such as TBPs in urbanized areas"
"Today reforestation, together with habitat fragmentation, may lead to an increase in tick-suitable habitats and thus potentially to a rise in pathogen prevalence...The re-colonization of abandoned land and reforestation to ensure sustainability of forests are also considered as key factors in the emergence of TBDs via the creation of suitable tick habitats...Reforestation, however, is likely to open up new areas with a suitable microclimate and host populations allowing the establishment of ticks and the epidemiological cycle of TBDs"
"a large number of the emerging viruses of humans appear to have arisen from rodents rather than primates . This implies that the high density of many rodent populations allows them to carry a greater diversity of pathogens and/or that rodents often live in close proximity to humans which increases the probability of exposure"
"For viral zoonoses, rainfall may enhance risk by increasing animal reservoir populations."
"rich food resources may increase the birth and litter survival rates of urban-adapted species, thus intensifying the parasite transmission due to the abundance of highly susceptible juvenile hosts."
"In urban and peri-urban areas, the frequency of contact between wildlife and humans changes from sporadic encounters to permanently sharing the environment, thus greatly increasing the chance of parasite transmission to humans"
"Several zoonotic agents can be directly transmitted from wildlife to humans, e.g., Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, can be transmitted by skin contact with an infested, diseased, or dead hare or rodent. By contrast, rabies virus is transmitted by bite (saliva) from a rabid animal. Hantaviruses are spread from rodents to humans by aerosols in dust from rodent excreta."
"Wild rodents also constitute a reservoir of hantaviruses. The viruses are shed in urine, droppings, and saliva, and humans are mainly infected aerogenically by inhaling aerosols containing the virus. Precipitation, habitat structure, and food availability are critical environmental factors that affect rodent population dynamics as well as viral transmission between animals and subsequently the incidence of human infection. The deer mouse is a reservoir host for Sin Nombre hantavirus, which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States. Because of climatic changes with increased rainfall in recent years, host abundance, and thereby spread of the pathogen, has increased, with subsequent transmission to humans."
"Microbial changes or adaptation also influence the epidemiology of zoonoses with a wildlife reservoir. These changes include mutations, such as genetic drift in viruses; activation and silencing of genes; genetic recombinations, such as genetic shift in viruses; and conjugation, transformation, and transduction in bacteria. Natural selection and evolution also play a role. Transmission of adaptive or genetically changed microorganisms from wildlife to humans, either directly or indirectly through domestic animals, may occur in many ways. In this respect an international wildlife trade, often illegal, in which wild animals end up in live-animal markets, restaurants, and farms, is important because such practices increase the proximity between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans."
"Despite their large phylogenetic distance from humans, many of our zoonoses and probably two of our established diseases (plague and typhus) have been acquired from rodents, because of their high abundance and frequent encounters with humans in dwellings."
"Certainly, for parasitic emerging and re-emerging infections, human encroachment into wildlife habitat or increased wildlife populations that thrive in a human environment are factors that allow such emergence or re-emergence."
"The distribution of non-migratory mammals may be important in the aetiology of enzootic and zoonotic diseases. In some parts of a geographic landscape rodent burrows may be concentrated in large numbers to form “villages” as by gerbils (Rhombomys spp.) in Central Asia and “towns” by prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus) in the USA. The gerbil burrows provide a habitat for sandflies which are vectors of leishmaniasis and from which the gerbils also suffer. Prairie dogs suffer from plague (Yersinia pestis) of which they are donors. They are also harbour the vectors, fleas of the genus Oropsylla."
"Human settlements, villages, roads, farms and ranches: Old buildings, cemeteries and abandoned human habitations provide shelter for several potential wild animal disease donors including hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), rodents, tortoises, snakes and lizards that are food sources Ornithodorus ticks and sand flies, vectors of relapsing fever and leishmaniasis respectively. Abandoned kraals and manyattas in East Africa often swarm with hungry fleas (usually Ctenocephalides felis) and soft ticks (Ornithodorus moubata). "
"Domestic animals may enhance the transmission of wildlife pathogens to humans because they are more likely to come into contact with wild species. The close and consistent association between domestic animals and people then makes successful pathogen transfer more likely."
"As with other wildlife, importation of exotic rodents can drive viral emergence. In 2003, a multistate US monkeypox outbreak was driven by exposure to prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), which were infected by exposure to imported Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys spp.) (Centers for Disease Control, Prevention., 2003). Also, one human case was acquired from a rabbit that became infected when exposed to a prairie dog in a veterinary setting. In this case, rodents commercially captured in forested areas of southern Ghana were the sources of the US outbreak, and a 2010 study by the US CDC found that 53% of nearby human residents had been previously exposed to orthopox viruses (Reynolds et al., 2010). While the 2003 outbreak was likely a spillover event, surveillance efforts focused on the international rodent pet trade may detect such events and enable genotypic/phenotypic characterization of viruses that jump among rodent species and to humans and pets."
"Large scale political transitions can also impact on zoonotic disease. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe, for example, and the consequent agricultural and economic reforms, have been linked to a complex series of factors that acted independently yet synergistically to increase tick-borne disease (e.g. decline of agriculture and regeneration of shrubs leading to increases in transmitting rodents, greater leisure time contributing to greater exposure to ticks in forests)"
"Urban and periurban changes in land use have altered the availability and quality of habitat available to wildlife, and ecological changes in resource availability have in instances increased the potential for human–animal–vector interactions. Later chapters illustrate how ecological changes have influenced the abundance and accessibility of wildlife species serving as reservoir hosts for different pathogens, leading to the emergence of zoonotic pathogens associated with pteropid bats and white-tailed deer."
"Thus, whilst transportation has played a major role in the dispersal of Ae aegypti-and their associated arboviruses, the primary factor for the global emergence of these epidemic viruses, in each case, is the adaptation to and domestication of the arthropod vector Ae aegypti to urban environments with a preference for feeding on humans."
"As an example, land-use change is often suggested as a risk factor for emerging zoonoses, but there are multiple ways in which changes in land use and habitat might affect the infection dynamics of zoonotic pathogens, including (1) an increase in the number of reservoir hosts, (2) an increase in the incidence of infection in reservoir hosts, or (3) a change in the pattern, rate or frequency of contact between reservoir and human hosts."
"Thus, changes in farming practices can affect zoonotic disease emergence through changing infection rates in animal reservoirs, and/or by increasing contact between reservoirs and samplers."
"For other zoonotic pathogens, direct contact between animals and humans may also be an important route of transmission, this could be the case for Brucella spp., Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or some newer strains of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). "
"Though the effects of counter-urbanization on EID risk remain poorly studied, it is clear that disease dynamics can be altered by socioeconomic transitions that bring about behavioral modification alongside changes in land management and access to service-providing infrastructure. This suggests that counter-urbanization can spur disease emergence because occupancy becomes juxtaposed with abandonment, resulting in novel human-environment interfaces shaped by management release and infrastructure degradation. Re-greening and community assembly also can allow for altered population dynamics, habitat shifts, and increased contact rates between humans and pathogens or pathogen vectors."
