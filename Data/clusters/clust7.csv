"Many foodborne zoonoses are enzootic in livestock (eg, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, and some helminth infections), especially in low-income and middle-income countries, and result in endemic infections and outbreaks of disease in people. Cultural and farming practices such as stocking rates, mixing of species, methods of confinement, and feeding, and lack of proper implementation of disease-control methods— because of weak veterinary infrastructures and in sufficient public–private partnerships to support and strengthen them—can serve to maintain or spread zoonotic diseases in livestock and provide a source of new infections in susceptible human populations. The techniques with which animals are slaughtered and processed, and how products are stored, packed, transported, and prepared at the place they are consumed, also enable foodborne disease outbreaks."
"Unplanned migration due to war or natural disasters has played a large part in introducing infectious diseases into humans. Refugee camps, resettlement areas, and temporary shelters are often characterized by crowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and populations having poor nutrition status, limited access to clean water and medical care, as well as being poorly vaccinated, and lacking separation from insects and animals in the environment"
"The changing use of water in modern agriculture, the food industry and by human communities may also lead to an increased spread of waterborne parasitic diseases...contaminated water is an important source of human infection either by direct consumption or by the use of contaminated water in food processing or preparation"
"Travellers dining in street restaurants can be expected to have much higher risks of infections with various parasites"
"The world is undergoing human population growth and massive urbanization. These processes are associated with displacement of people from rural areas to urban centers, creating new contacts and interactions in the new densely populated environment. The newcomers are usually more vulnerable to the endemic diseases to which they may not be immune. On the other hand they may introduce new pathogens and vectors to the new environment. Under these conditions, the chances for exchange and transmission of vectors and parasites increase. Unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization in developing countries usually results in the deterioration of public health infrastructure, sanitation, water, sewage and waste management systems. In addition, the construction of new roads provides means of vector and host transportation. These alterations produce ideal conditions for the transmission of vector-borne diseases to large populations."
"War as well as civil unrest prevent active intervention and proper public health measures for disease prevention (e.g. vector control, vaccination and access to health services)."
"Incorrect global and governmental management is associated with the emergence and re-emergence of diseases. This includes an imbalanced distribution of resources, lack of sound public health policy, emphasis on emergency response rather than prevention, and shortage of experts trained to respond effectively to emerging and re-emerging infections"
"Re-emerging diseases are diseases which were once decreasing, but are now rapidly increasing again. Classical public health and sanitation measures have long served to minimise dissemination and human exposure to many pathogens which are spread by traditional routes (such as water or food), or are preventable by immunisation or vector control. However, the pathogens themselves often till remain, in small pockets of infection, and may therefore re-emerge if circumstances allow. Often these circumstances are breakdowns in disease prevention and control measures. Thus, re-emerging infectious diseases are often conventionally understood and well-recognised public health threats for which (in most cases) previously active public health or control measures have been allowed to lapse. This is a situation that unfortunately now applies all too often, in both developing countries and the inner cities of the industrialised world. The appearance of re-emerging diseases may often be a sign of the breakdown of public health measures. It should also be a warning against complacency when considering infectious diseases."
"Intensive livestock farming can promote disease transmission through environmental pathways. Ventilation systems expel material...into the environment, increasing risk of transmission to wild and domestic animals. Large quantities of waste are produced that contain a variety of pathogens capable of survival for several months if left untreated. Much of the waste is spread on land, where it can come into contact with wild animals and contaminate water. Similarly, use of animal waste in aquaculture leads to potential contact with wild birds"
"Hunters are increasingly recognized as an important target group for zoonotic infections, through direct exposure to agents existing in the soil of forests/hunting areas in general, or through direct contact with and consumption of infected wildlife meat products"
"Politics also exert a direct effect on the prevalence of zoonotic infections. The typical example here is the transition of numerous countries in recent years from communist, strictly state-controlled economies to free trade. This has led to the resurgence of numerous zoonotic agents, owing to less strict veterinarian and public health surveillance, but also to the recognition of hitherto undetermined/underevaluated zoonotic foci...when political transition was associated with conflict...the social substrate for zoonotic outbreaks became stronger, aided by factors such as famine, involuntary immigration of large human populations, and total breakdown and delayed redevelopment of public health and medical infrastructures"
"Transmission in the Farm, Fair, or Petting Zoo...Animal fur, hair, skin, and saliva can harbor infectious organisms due to fecal contamination. Transmission occurs when people pet, touch, feed, or are licked by animals, or when they have contacted contaminated animal bedding, flooring, barriers, or other contaminated surfaces, including strollers, clothes, and shoes"
"direct harm can result when livestock manure contaminates municipal water supplies...Animal manure has been found to be the source of more than 100 zoonotic pathogens that may directly contaminate the food supply."
"Urbanization, an important land-use trend and the dominant demographic trend of the twenty-first century, also provides new pathways for infectious disease exposure. Much of the rapid urbanization occurring today is taking place in urban or periurban slums with few services for clean water provision, sewage disposal, solid waste management, or quality housing. In these settings, piles of municipal waste, pools of contaminated water, and refuse, like old tires capable of holding water, create excellent habitat for a variety of rodent hosts and arthropod vectors"
"The very act of farming may have resulted in exposure to novel pathogens...agricultural practices such as irrigation and the use of human feces as fertilizer would have increased exposure to pathogens"
"Agriculture could sustain 10–100 times higher human population densities than did the hunting–gathering lifestyle, and sedentary farmers living amid their own sewage or even spreading their feces and urine as fertilizer on the fields provided ideal conditions for the emergence of both crowd and zoonotic diseases"
"After the introduction of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine, bacteria resistant to antibiotics rapidly emerged, and the importance of spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from animals to humans became more and more recognized. Resistant bacteria from animals can be transmitted to humans not only by direct contact, but also via food products of animal origin"
"Untreated surface water in unpopulated areas may be contaminated through wild animal reservoir hosts"
"evidence indicates that in developing countries, small-scale animal husbandry practices could be affecting water supplies and increasing risk of zoonotic diarrheal and other waterborne diseases"
"A lack of proper hand washing behaviors, the failure to wash fruits and vegetables with clean water prior to eating, practicing open defecation near the camp/household, ritual or cultural use of animal products, and the recreational use of environmental water sources for drinking, bathing, laundry, watering animals, and fishing were noted as risk factors for zoonotic enteric parasite exposure"
"Globalization increases the risk of FBHs, particularly in fish and meat products, but also vegetables and fruits, due to the large amounts of exports and imports of food products occurring globally."
"Globalization is an important aspect in the foodborne transmission of parasites. Fish and other animals produced in areas endemic for FBH are shipped globally, as are fruit and vegetables which may contain helminths. Depending on the food regulations in the country these products are imported to, infected fish, meat or fruits and vegetables may make it to the consumer, leading to infection in nonendemic areas. Imported live animals can also harbour parasites either from their originating country or having been picked up en route."
"In the developed world, urbanization is typically implemented in a structured way, often with green areas, whereas in developing countries the expansion of urban areas happens much faster, is less structured and can lead to poor infrastructure, poor housing, high human density, impoverished suburbs and highly polluted city centres. Both types of expansion can create conditions suitable for tick and host existence and thus lead to the emergence of TBDs"
"Many re-emergences have been catalysed by wars, loss of social cohesion, and natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, indicating the importance not only of microbial and viral factors, but also of social and environmental determinants."
"Modification of natural habitats by human population activities and increased pet populations are also associated with the emergence of parasitic zoonoses such as toxoplasmosis."
"In developing countries, densely packed housing in shanty towns or slums and inadequate drinking-water supplies, garbage collection services and surface-water drainage systems combine to create favorable habitats for the proliferation of vectors."
"Travel to exotic locations as well as changes in our feeding habits, including the internationalisation of exotic and trendy cuisine such as consumption of sushi, sashimi or ceviche, also lead to emergence or re-emergence of parasitic diseases such as anisakiasis or gnathostomiasis or diphyllobothriasis."
"Tourism in exotic countries may also expose large numbers of visitors to contaminated food."
"Wars and social upheavals have also been associated with emergence or re-emergence of parasitic zoonoses. As reported by Cuperlovic et al., prevalence of trichinellosis in domestic animals and humans is high in Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia, but moderate in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Hungary, human trichinellosis has not been reported for many years; but sporadic cases were recorded in swine in recent years. Sporadic human cases of trichinellosis have been reported in Slovenia and Turkey, but not in Greece or Macedonia. The re-emergence of trichinellosis is connected with the changes in the social and political systems in Bulgaria and Romania but also to wars that took place at the end of the 20th century in Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. Similarly, Trichinella outbreaks associated with inadequate meat inspection were reported after 2000 in Lithuania and Latvia where the annual incidence was 06 and 07–1/100,000 population, respectively. Similarly, a 2003 report of emergent visceral leishmaniasis in an area of civil conflict in Somalia identified high rates of infection."
"Other factors that may explain the emergence of some zoonotic parasitic diseases are the increase of the population of highly susceptible persons because of ageing, malnutrition, HIV infection and other underlying medical conditions;"
"and changes in lifestyle, such as the increase in the number of people eating meals prepared in restaurants, canteens and fast food outlets as well as from street food vendors who do not always respect food safety, and the increase of eating raw or undercooked meats."
"Water is a major vehicle for many environmental stages of parasites. These stages can contaminate foodstuffs such as fruits, vegetables and shellfish. It is often difficult to associate an outbreak with a particular food item, and therefore, if the food-borne route is suspected, to identify how the food implicated became contaminated. Because of these difficulties, the acquisition of parasitic infections via the food-borne route is almost certainly under-detected by a factor 10 or more."
"Infective stages of parasites shed in the environment with faeces can contaminate foodstuffs such as vegetables, fruits of fruit juices."
"Humans get infected by eating raw or undercooked meat infected with cyst stages of these parasites."
"Meat of reptiles, amphibians and fish can be infected with a variety of parasites, including trematodes (Opisthorchis spp., Clonorchis sinensis, minute intestinal flukes), cestodes (Diphyllobothrium spp., Spirometra), nematodes (Gnathostoma, spp., Anisakidae), and pentastomids that can cause zoonotic infections in humans when consumed raw or not properly cooked."
"The lack of housing barriers to rodents, bats and arthropod vectors are major vulnerabilities to pathogens carried by them. Environmental and sanitation deficiencies also increase risk to enteric and vector-borne viruses; in the absence of dependable water supply, many people, for example, are forced to store containers of water that provide breeding for the virus-carrying mosquitoes."
"The human-animal interface is fluid and our interaction with other species, and any potential zoonotic agents they may possess, is variable. The frequency and type of human-animal interaction fluctuates in response to other external factors that, in turn, influence the potential for transmission of zoonotic agents. For instance, socioeconomic factors are hypothesized to be a major determinant of the spatial distribution of emerging infectious disease events. Socioeconomic pressures influence bushmeat hunting, a practice that is believed to be a major contributor to disease emergence, by obliging some populations to hunt to meet basic nutritional requirements in response to food availability. Similarly, studies of Lassa fever in Guinea and Sierra Leone directly correlate the risk of infection with Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by an arenavirus transmitted by rodents, with poor housing and food storage conditions in refugee camps and other desperately poor communities. "
"For some infections, zoonotic transmission occurs indirectly through food. Human brucellosis is not usually acquired through animal contact but is transmitted more often by consumption of infected animal products such as unpasteurized dairy products. Salmonella spp. have repeatedly caused outbreaks of salmonellosis after persons have eaten uncooked eggs. Hepatitis E virus has been transmitted through consumption of uncooked deer meat."
"Sporting activities can expose humans to zoonotic infections. Hunting wildlife has been associated with infections such as brucellosis and tularemia. Less obvious routes arise from activities such as water sports. Leptospira spp.–infected animals excrete viable organisms in their urine, which can persist in aquatic environments for prolonged periods."
"The Built Environment - including public health infrastructure such as sanitation, water supply, wastewater and solid waste treatment - is a core defence against pathogens and disease transmission in most parts of the world. Many pathogenic microorganisms can contaminate water. Leptospirosis, for example, is caused by contact with the urine of infected animals or urine-polluted water contaminated by infected wild animals. New methods of sustainable waste treatment and management influence potential exposure to pathogens. Increases in community and industrial composting facilities can release a large quantity of aerosolised particles into the air. Several zoonotic pathogens such as Mycobacterium avium, E. coli 0157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp can be detected during the composting process. Moreover, land application of bio-solids from animal origins are known to create various pathways to increase human exposure to the pathogens."
"Significant changes in the demography of global human populations during the past five decades have been driven not only by population growth, but by changes in population distribution and social structuring brought about by migration, the ongoing movement of persons from rural to urban environments and the resettlement of refugees. The concentration of humans in the urban environment has given rise to mega-cities where a large proportion of persons may live in substandard conditions in marginal areas, sometimes referred to as shanty towns, surrounding the urban core. The crowded living conditions within shanty towns are further degraded by poor sanitation and lack of water; these conditions have been associated with the emergence of diseases, notably those involving vector-transmitted pathogens."
"As discussed above, poverty also has strong links to NTDs, specifically by its social expression as substandard housing conditions, lack of access to safe water, and poor environmental sanitation. A major determinant of risk for NTD transmission is poor housing (e.g., cracked mud walls, thatched roofs, damp earthen floors, or lack of indoor plumbing), which can obstruct and complicate vector control efforts, leading to increased exposure to diseases such as dengue, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, and Chagas disease. This occurs in resource-poor and even developed country settings in low-income communities. Poor sanitation due to inadequate garbage disposal/collection can also result in breeding sites for many NTD arthropod vectors (such as the sandfly) and subsequently increased risk."
"As settlements became cities, a second transition point was reached: the problems of sanitation and pest control increased, allowing huge epidemics of infections, such as the black death and cholera."
"For example, urbanisation actually summarises a large number of different factors, each of which affects the underlying epidemiology of a particular pathogen in different ways. Urbanisation could lead to disease emergence as a result of poverty (which could increase susceptibility of human populations), high population densities, crowded housing, poor sanitation (which could all affect contact rates and the number of spreaders), and/or a breakdown in social values and public health (which could affect both infection rates and contact rates)."
"Climate change may place a strain on agricultural industries as they try to retain crop productivity during droughts or periods of intense precipitation. To compensate for these crop stresses, increased fertilizer use is encouraged. Animal fertilizers, as well as human biosolids used as fertilizers, have the potential to contain parasitic cysts and oocysts. Heavy rainfall events, which may increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change, will more often wash fertilizers into local waterways. Heavy rainfall events can also simply extract cysts and oocysts from soil and grass, and these events have been associated with outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis."
"First, extreme rainfall events and flooding may render some wastewater treatment plants unable to accommodate the amount of influent sewage. Wastewater treatment plants are typically equipped with overflow systems that allow excess sewage to bypass treatment, other than a primary filter that removes large debris. This sewage then gets returned to the waterway untreated and with parasitic organisms still infective. This issue is augmented for island nations that flood easily during extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, and the groundwater may even be contaminated. ... In either case discussed, humans ultimately come into contact with these contaminated waters and drink or otherwise ingest parasites because of climatic events."
"Soil-transmitted helminthiases ... Macroscopic parasites directly interact with their environments when part of their life cycle occurs outside of a host. Helminths such as hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichuria are present in soils before infecting a host, and certain soil components may be fundamentally altered by a changing climate. Higher temperatures can cause faster larvae development and development within eggs for hookworms, which ultimately decreases their time to infectivity. Increased precipitation levels could prevent desiccation of eggs/larvae thus allowing greater survival rates of these parasites. Similarly, increased humidity levels would increase larval survival in soil, especially for hookworms as their larvae are at a greater risk of desiccation compared with other helminth species."
"Through eating, direct contact, and via the environment, the human—and the animal bacterial flora are in contact with each other. Figure 1 outlines the most important transmission routes for bacteria between the human and the animal reservoir. Via these routes bacteria from (food) animals may enter the human reservoir and vice versa. The foodborne route is probably the most important gateway for this contact. The vast majority of infections with enteric zoonotic bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica, probably occurs through this route. "
"Bacteria from production animals are widespread in the environment, mainly as a result of their presence in manure. Thus, the environment and wild fauna also transforms into reservoirs of foodborne pathogens and resistance, and forms a source of (resistant) pathogenic bacteria into the food animals and human reservoirs."
"Environmental degradation, struggles for control of scare resources, bad governance and even energy appears to be a major push factor resulting in forced migration. There is also a hypothetical possibility that aid workers returning from a containment zone of an emerging infectious disease, such as novel pandemic influenza, may introduce the virus causing this pandemic into conflict settings."
"Pathogen resistance to drugs can contribute to disease emergence. Resistance may develop more rapidly in conflict situations because of inappropriate diagnoses or inappropriate drug regimens and outdated drugs. Treatment compliance may be poor because of purchase of insufficient quantities of drugs, selling or saving of them by patients, or interrupted treatment with sudden displacement or irregular access to healthcare facilities. In addition, private pharmacies, which can flourish in conflict situations because of no regulation, can compound this problem with drugs of unknown quality and acceptance of prescriptions from unqualified prescribers."
