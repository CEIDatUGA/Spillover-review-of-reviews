"Increasing demand for food due to an expanding global population has led to a substantial susceptibility of our populations to food-borne zoonoses. Pathogens in the livestock production chain are a particular risk, with repeated outbreaks from meat, eggs, milk, and cheese, or meat byproducts incorporated into foods as flavouring, oils, or stock. Globally, most types of domesticated and wild vertebrates and many invertebrates are foods for people; such foods are capable of harbouring zoonotic bacteria, viruses, or parasites."
"increased livestock production in developing countries without adequate disease-management practices might lead to the emergence of other pathogens due to the introduction of new hosts."
"Several pathways exist through which antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic pathogens could be transmitted from livestock to people, including through food consumption, direct contact with treated animals, waste management, use of manure as fertiliser, faecal contamination of run-off , movement of fomites through water and wind, and translocation or migration of animals."
"As result of demographic growth and an increase in quality of life in developed countries, in order to meet rising demand for products of animal origin, agriculture has been intensified and the number and concentration of livestock is increasing rapidly, especially poultry and pigs...The major share of this growth will be supplied by developing countries...where biosecurity regimes may be not always sufficient in preventing livestock from disease"
"the emerging trend is for more extensive and outdoor livestock rearing to comply with increasing public demand for organic production and management practices to improve animal welfare. Such free-ranging livestock in close contact with both the environment and wildlife may constitute an opportunity for emerging parasitic infections"
"As a result of urbanisation (more than 50% of the global population now lives in urban areas), demographic increase and market forces, food (including contaminated food) is now moving on a global scale, carried rapidly from continent to continent. The deployment of more efficient and rapid means of transporting perishable goods worldwide enable fresh products to be available nearly year round. Together, these factors have influenced the emergence and recognition of some foodborne parasites"
"traditional and local food markets in many parts of the world can be associated with emergence of new foodborne parasitic diseases. Live animal markets, also known as wet markets, have always been the principal mode of commercialization of poultry and many other animal species. Such markets, quite uncommon until some decades ago in developed countries, are emerging as a new mode of commercialization within specific ethnic groups for whom this type of trade assures freshness of the product but raises major public health concerns"
"Livestock located in communities that border the habitats of wild and endangered species can act as a reservoir for intestinal parasites that can then be transmitted between people and wild animals"
"many cultures value fresh, live animal protein over previously butchered or prepared/refrigerated/frozen. These live animals are traded and sold in markets (“wet markets”) that bring together diverse species in high densities under relatively poor conditions. Several major epidemics have originated from such locations"
"The advent of agriculture around 10<U+2009>000 years ago was pivotal in giving rise to many of the infections we know today. Agricultural-based societies led to humans living in close proximity both to each other and to livestock. In turn, human settlements provided fertile ground for interspecies transmission between farm animals, rodents, dogs, cats and insects. "
"The worldwide distribution of infected pigs means there is ample opportunity for transmission, especially in Southeast Asia where most pigs are kept in family smallholdings."
"Many zoonotic diseases and human pathogens result from our intimate contacts with domesticated animals, a process that has continued since the early days of domestication. The capture and controlled breeding of the major animal domesticates was part of a suite of transformations in human society known as the Neolithic transition. This is best described in the archaeological record of the Near East, particularly the Fertile Crescent, which witnessed the development of the first agricultural economy in the world, starting more than 10,000 years ago. The biological products of this remarkably innovative region are now widespread and include plants such as barley, the wheats, lentils, and four of the major domestic livestock species (in temporal order: goats, sheep, pigs and cattle) (Fig. 1). It is likely that ‘crowd diseases’ such as smallpox, measles, rubella and pertussis emerged following the advent of agriculture and associated settlements. The domestication of farm animals enabled surplus food production, and this paved the way for human population clusters, and the first urban centres, which were large enough for these infections to be maintained."
"In operations such as food production chains, which process or use products of biological origin, modern production methods yield increased efficiency and reduced costs, but can increase the chances of accidental contamination and amplify the effects of such contamination. A pathogen present in some of the raw material may find its way into a large batch of the final product, as happened with the contamination of hamburger meat by the E. coli strains that cause HUS."
"Intensification of livestock production, especially pigs and poultry, facilitates disease transmission by increasing population size and density"
"Intensive livestock systems generally have high density populations of low genetic diversity, which may favor increased transmission and adaptation. Epidemiological modeling experiments indicate that lower genetic diversity was associated with an increased probability of a major epidemic or no epidemic at all, whereas a more diverse population had a higher probability of a minor epidemic"
"The rapid transport and cold storage facilities enable the survival of parasites in food as well as surface contaminants"
"The paleoparasitological findings since then have always shown the presence of zoonotic parasites transmitted mainly by consumption of and/or contact with domesticated animals. The domestication of animals and plants favored an increase in the occurrence of parasitosis among human populations, as exemplified in specific regions...With domestication, humans kept animals close to them for consumption, like cattle, goats, and pigs, as well as companion animals like dogs and cats...This constant contact with animals facilitated the transmission of parasites, including zoonotic ones"
"climate changes affected the production of cultivated grains, leading to subsistence crises. The population was thus forced to turn to the consumption of wild vegetables, and also hunting and fishing, often consuming raw items"
"Management factors can also increase the risk of pathogen transmission at animal exhibits. For example, animals are more likely to shed pathogens due to stress from prolonged transportation, confinement, crowding, and increased handling by humans"
"Communities planting crops settled and grew in relatively fixed locations. This likely increased their exposure to their own waste as well as to reservoirs of disease such as unintentional rodent domesticants that may have set up permanent habitats proximate to human dwellings"
"the domestication of animals around 10,000 years ago likely provided the greatest conduit for zoonotic disease transmission"
"The immunosuppressive stress of prolonged live animal transport may not only increase a healthy animal’s susceptibility to infection, but may trigger the emergence of a variety of diarrheal and respiratory diseases caused by endogenous microoganisms that might not normally lead to disease. Long-distance transport may also increase the fecal shedding of zoonotic disease agents."
"Driven by the population explosion, urbanization, and increasing incomes, the per-capita consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products has dramatically expanded in the developing world...Animal agriculture worldwide is increasingly moving from the relatively low efficiency, family-centered, low-input model to intensive systems, which are loosely defined as the production of large numbers of genotypically-similar animals often under concentrated confinement with rapid population turnover...Unnaturally high concentrations of animals confined indoors in a limited airspace and producing significant quantities of waste may allow for the rapid selection, amplification, and dissemination of zoonotic pathogens"
"The disease-scape changed dramatically after the adoption of agriculture. New proximity to domestic animals created many opportunities for novel pathogens to infect, and eventually adapt, to humans...Peri-domestic animals such as rodents and sparrows, which developed permanent habitats in and around human dwellings, could also represent important sources of disease"
"Changes in nutrition and food handling would also have altered disease risk. The shift to agriculture resulted in a reduction of the dietary niche, which would have predisposed many individuals to dietary deficiencies uncommon in the Pleistocene...Nutritional deficiencies, which alone were sufficient to cause disease, would also have altered host immune competence, making humans in this time-period more susceptible to infection following contact with a pathogen"
"The industrial revolution also resulted in a human–animal interface characterized by massive increase of domestic and food animal populations, as well as intensification of farming and husbandry practices—still continuing to this day. These unprecedented crowd conditions are undoubtedly major drivers of the emergence and spread of pathogens in domestic animal populations, allowing their increasingly more frequent cross-species transmission to humans"
"The global movement of animals associated with legal and illegal trade is not restricted to food production animals and concerns as well pets, including exotic species, and wildlife...Due to their nature, exotic pet species carry an unmatched range of ‘‘exotic’’ pathogens...On a broader scale, the legal and illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife products represents a major source of emerging infectious diseases, from local scales, involving bushmeat hunting and wet markets, to cross-continental scales. It expands the diversity of animal species coming into contact with humans and their domestic animals. These diseases may affect humans, their domestic animals, or other wild animal species, thus also expanding the dire consequences of their cross-species transmission across the contemporary human–animal interface."
"A particular concern—implicit but not highlighted in the IOM’s list—is increasing use of “exotic” animal species, whether as food, farm animals or pets, and the trade that accompanies this."
"nomads and pastoralists have significant animal contact through their work with livestock and interactions with wildlife. Herding animals across large ranges and handling animals for food products means close contact with livestock."
"Globalization has led to an increased demand for fish and other marine foods worldwide, which requires suppliers to increase production, naturally leading to an increase in farmed fish and other aquaculture. Increased levels of intensive aquaculture give rise to increased infections of fishborne FBH"
"Animal husbandry is assumed to have been a source of human exposure to zoonoses since ancient times. Among the large variety of vertebrates that can act as amplification hosts for different zoonotic TBDs, pets and livestock represent some of the largest reservoirs for human infection. In developing countries, densely populated urban and peri-urban slums are a common side effect of urbanization which often harbour high densities of domestic animals such as poultry, pigs or small ruminants. These are bred in small-scale private farms and serve, amongst others things, as a source of food, income and security. They live in close contact with humans. This scenario with plenty of hosts, especially for adult ticks, provides excellent conditions for tick existence, and the close contact to humans can result in the emergence of TBDs."
"Driven by human population growth, the global structure of animal husbandry and agriculture has undergone severe changes in recent decades. The invention of industrial farming in agriculture has led to considerable advances in human welfare all over the world, but these new technologies also bear the danger of causing new health hazards in the form of zoonotic diseases. Especially in the developing countries, an ever increasing demand for meat and milk production on a large scale is expected in the near future."
"Thus, the rise of agriculture starting 11,000 years ago played multiple roles in the evolution of animal pathogens into human pathogens. Those roles included both generation of the large human populations necessary for the evolution and persistence of human crowd diseases, and generation of large populations of domestic animals, with which farmers came into much closer and more frequent contact than hunter/gatherers had with wild animals."
"Similarly, about half of our established temperate diseases have been acquired from domestic livestock, because of high local abundance and very frequent contact."
"Bats, civets, and other mammals are traded in large numbers in Chinese wet  markets, but the origins of these animals are often many hundreds of miles from their point of sale. With an increasing demand for wild animal meat as China’s economy grows, pathogen spillover from this wildlife trade is likely to be a continuing problem. Wildlife trade also leads to the movement of animals over great distances and has caused the emergence of viruses in areas significantly outside their natural range."
"The practice of “multi-species land use” and buffer zones in which domestic animals graze the same lands as wildlife also facilitates transmission of disease across two groups."
"Vector-borne infections of people and animals that are maintained by wild reservoir hosts are particularly likely to have well defined geographical limits. These are determined by environmental factors, especially climate and soil type, which in turn influence the vegetation and thus the spatial distribution of wildlife. Translocation for conservation and other reasons and trade is now enormous and global. Domestic animals trekking between grazing areas and water holes and moving to market - sometimes for international sale - provide opportunities for the spread of disease agents and their arthropod vectors. The burgeoning increase in the consumption of bushmeat in many parts of the world also provides opportunities for the spread of disease"
"What is known, however, is that the interface between humans and animals is of paramount importance in the process. As we increase our interactions with animals through hunting, the trading of animal foods, animal husbandry practices, wet markets, and the domestication of animals or exotic pets, the probability of cross-species transmission dramatically increases."
"To support the growing human population, we have an increasing demand for nutritional support, resulting in intensive agricultural practices, sometimes involving enormous numbers of animals, or multiple species farmed within the same region. These practices can facilitate infection to cross species barriers."
"Species now linked by domestication to Homo sapiens provide rich fodder for evolutionary forays by zoonotic viruses into potential new hosts. The emergence of zoonotic viruses among humans or domestic livestock where our species has drifted into preexisting sylvatic foci of zoonotic viruses is driven by local circumstance, history, and serendipity. The role of livestock, such as horses and pigs, can be pivotal in a transmission chain leading to human infection, as illustrated by the henipaviruses."
"Other domesticated species have become efficiently enlisted as HIs or HRs, in a bridging process leading to human disease. Swine production management practices have improved the efficacy of this economically important livestock species as an amplifying HI for JEV and NiV transmission to humans. Swine may also serve as the mammalian mixing vessel for influenza A viruses of domestic and wild birds, offering the opportunity for avian viruses to obtain the complement of genes required for their sustained transmission within mammalian hosts, such as humans."
"Especially in developing countries, transmission of micro-organisms can occur from live animals or via blood products from slaughtering practises within the home setting, but the actual transmission pathways are often unknown. In these countries livestock keeping is common practise for many families and animals are frequently kept in the home backyard for egg, milk or meat production. Backyard poultry keeping has been linked to Avian Influenza transmission on many occasions. "
"For people with occupational contact with livestock, the risk of acquiring micro-organisms from livestock was especially elevated, since transmission of infections seems to be possible during all phases of the livestock production cycle; from stables until the slaughterhouse."
"Although, we found a significant body of evidence that described zoonotic transmissions of micro-organisms, little is known about the intensity and type of contact patterns leading to transmission, and thus the exact transmission pathways of micro-organisms from livestock to humans usually remains unclear."
"For example, groups with more zoonotic host species than expected for the richness of the clade (e.g., orders that fall above a regression line through points in Figure 2) may share suites of similar intrinsic or extrinsic factors enabling more-successful pathogen transmission, or more frequent human contacts that, over time, facilitate the transition of a novel infection to a disease state in humans (e.g., the ungulates, a paraphyletic group that includes the Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla; ungulates comprise the majority of domesticated mammal species)... For example, the marsupial carnivores (Dasyuromorpha), much like placental carnivores (Carnivora), have less direct contact with humans compared to other clades (e.g., rodents, ungulates), which may reduce the risk of zoonotic transmission to humans. However, many dasyuromorphs have regular contact with domesticated species (for example, domesticated dogs, especially when Tasmanian devils and quolls are attracted to livestock on farms), providing an opportunity for human exposure through farm animals on human-modified environments."
"The first key transition in human societies is likely to have been the domestication of livestock 10,000–15,000 years ago, which provided multiple opportunities for disease emergence, first by facilitating cross-species (zoonotic) transmission and, second by allowing the expansion of human settlements large enough for virulent pathogens, such as measles and smallpox, to persist."
"Another important factor in influencing interspecific wildlife contact and human–livestock–wildlife contact in urban environments is resource provisioning. Clumping of resources occurs widely across urban environments at local (e.g., household) and landscape scales, whether as a result of variation in sanitation, refuse and agricultural byproducts, livestock-keeping practices, supplemental feeding of garden birds, or household food availability. Informal livestock keeping is commonplace in African cities, and often characterized by low biosecurity and mixed-species livestock being kept in close proximity to humans. Evidence from recent zoonotic emergence events in Asia (such as Nipah and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses) and the circulation of relatively stable zoonoses (such as hepatitis E and bovine tuberculosis) implicate a role for livestock acting as bridge hosts, epidemiologically linking wildlife and humans. While resource provisioning commonly leads to increased contact rates between synanthropic wildlife, humans, and livestock, pathogen dynamics are also driven by susceptibility to infection, which, depending on the nature of provisioning, can be increased or decreased by host physical condition and immune defense. ... Becker and Hall and Becker et al. also demonstrated host demographic, contact and immunological effects of provisioning on R0, finding that unless provisioning reduces dietary exposure to pathogens or strongly improves host condition and immunity, increased aggregations of wildlife species dramatically increase pathogen invasion success and long-term prevalence. Environmental stressors such as heavy metal and pesticide pollutants, characteristic of certain urban environments, can further compound these outcomes through their effects on immunological function. As such, resource provisioning is likely to increase host density (a key driver of transmission rates) and wildlife–livestock–human contact, making such areas important interfaces for disease emergence."
"Although consumption of wildlife is not considered a major route in many developed countries, wildlife is consumed at a substantial level in developing countries. In addition, because of generally lower bio-safety levels in rural animal keeping, contact between humans and food animals may in general be more frequent in these countries."
"Fluctuations in host and vector abundance engender a variable risk distribution for disease transmission. Some species are unique in their proximity to human physiology (e.g. primates and wild pigs) or in their expansive ranges (e.g. birds and bats), posing unique threat as integrators, spreaders, and laboratories for recombination and mutation of disease pathogens "
"For some pathogens there is evidence that changes in the interface between wild animals, domestic animals and humans provided the opportunity for spillover of infection from wild animals. Subsequent spread was then determined by the ability of the pathogen to transmit amongst domestic animals and/or humans, or, in the case of vector-borne disease, suitable environmental conditions. This was facilitated in several cases by intensification of livestock production resulting in amplification of transmission within domestic animals and spillover of infection into humans."
"Sedentarism increased parasitic infection because of proximity of the living areas to source of waters and the areas where human waste was deposited. The contiguity of habitation to the space where domesticated animals were kept, created a cluster of disease vectors. ... The milk, hair, and skin of domesticates, as well as animal dust, transmitted anthrax, Q fever, brucellosis, and tuberculosis. Peridomestic animals such as rodents and sparrows, which are drawn to human habitats, are also a source of disease. Cultivation often exposes workers to insect bites, and diseases such as scrub typhus becomes common. Livingstone and Wiesenfeld show that slash-and-burn agriculture in West Africa exposed populations to the mosquito that is the vector for malaria. Environmental disturbances during the clearing and cultivating of land increase human contact with arthropod vectors that prefer human habitats and that carry yellow fever and filariasis. For example, Aedes aegypti (the vector for yellow fever and dengue) is an artificial container breeder. Irrigation agriculture and fertilizing with human waste increases contact with non-vector parasites"
"Peri-urban areas in Vietnam encompass socioecological transitions that elevate contact with commensal hosts, such as high levels of poultry diversity and livestock production shifting to residences, and patchwork configurations of land conversion and neglect. The spatial coincidence of other factors associated with transitioning peri-urban areas include greater refuse, standing water, intensive land use and changes in land management. Many of these conditions reflect the fluid demography, driven by high mobility (i.e., immigration and emigration), of peri-urban areas. Parallels can be readily drawn between peri-urban and counter-urban areas, which highlights the potential for abandonment and infrastructure decline to drive disease emergence (Table 1). It also indicates that elevated disease transmission risk is not an accident of time and place, but rather the product of identifiable change."
