"Many zoonoses can be linked to large-scale changes in land use that affect biodiversity and relations between animal hosts, people, and pathogens. Land modification, irrespective of reason, changes vegetation patterns, vector and host species dynamics (eg, abundance, distribution, and demographics), microclimates, and human contact with domestic and wild animals. All these factors are crucial in disease ecology. The effects have been well studied and described for vector-borne diseases such as malaria and Lyme disease. In northeastern USA, a historical cycle of deforestation, reforestation, and habitat fragmentation changed predator–prey populations and led to the emergence of Lyme disease. Prevalence of human alveolar echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, a tapeworm of wild and domestic canids, with small mammals serving as inter mediate hosts) in Tibet is correlated with overgrazing and degradation of pastures and the resulting increase in small mammal densities."
"Deforestation has accelerated exponentially since the beginning of the twentieth Century and in the Amazonian basin and parts of Southeast Asia has had a profound effect on local ecosystems, particularly by constraining the range of natural predators instrumental in keeping rodents, insects and other potential carriers of infectious disease under control.9 The reduction in biological diversity can trigger the invasion and spread of opportunistic species, heralding the emergence of disease through increased contact with local human populations."
"because higher host diversity often correlates with higher parasite diversity, altered biodiversity might also influence cross-species transmission"
"Loss of biodiversity can exacerbate the risk of pathogen spillover. In low diversity communities, vectors attain higher pathogen prevalences because they feed more frequently on primary reservoirs. Conversely, vectors in high biodiversity communities feed on a wider range of hosts, some of which are poor pathogen reservoirs, often resulting in lower pathogen prevalence at ecological community level"
"biodiversity may act inversely on the long-term prevalence of zoonoses, by creating a niche that favours reassortment and species jumping"
"higher overall animal biodiversity might facilitate a greater diversity of pathogens, and thereby a greater incidence of zoonotic disease in humans...The simple act of bringing a large number of humans in contact with a diverse pool of wildlife species sets the stage for the spillover of zoonotics"
"A beneficial role of biodiversity in limiting or preventing outbreaks of disease has been observed at genetic and species levels. In these studies, a reduction in species or genotypic diversity, for instance, is typically correlated with increases in pathogen prevalence in reservoir hosts or vectors. An increasing number of studies also show correlations between levels of species diversity, often measured as host species richness, and a variety of metrics of zoonotic disease occurrence in humans or zoonotic pathogen prevalence in animals or vectors, with lower species diversity generally correlated with increased infection rates...These studies suggest that biodiversity could be a factor in mitigating the risk of disease spillover, by reducing the transmission of zoonotic pathogens in their natural reservoirs, and subsequently to humans."
"greater biodiversity is expected to increase the hazard of emerging infectious diseases, because host diversity (e.g. mammalian diversity) is correlated with pathogen diversity, which is often assumed to predict hazard"
"land-use change can also introduce human-associated invasive species (rats, cats, pigs, etc.), altering the ecological community and diversity in ways that affect the pathogen community. Therefore, these human-associated species can act as bridge hosts, increasing zoonotic transmission via contacts with both humans and wildlife."
"Changes in land use affect VBPs by altering the interactions and abundance of wildlife and domestic hosts, vectors, and people"
"The dilution effect theory has, however, been challenged by different studies which show that the loss of biodiversity in some communities led to a decrease in disease risk. This happens when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when a suitable host species is dominant, highly abundant and widespread"
"It has also been suggested that wildlife host species richness is an important predictor of disease emergence. Conversely, however, biodiversity has also been linked to a decrease in disease risk through the ‘dilution effect’. This was first developed as a framework to infer the dynamics of tick-borne Lyme disease, and describes the association between increasing species richness and reduced disease risk, particularly when the most competent hosts were dominant in the community and alternative hosts negatively influenced the dominant hosts as reservoirs"
"Tropical forests are the ecosystems with the highest biodiversity (species richness) of all terrestrial ecosystems, and may harbour an estimated 50% of total global biodiversity. Along with this high biodiversity of ‘higher’ multi-cellular organisms, an immense richness of viral pathogens has also evolved. The increased contact between humans and wild animals along the interface of tropical forests and high population densities of humans and domestic animals pose a high risk for the emergence of novel diseases."
"One result of land degradation and fragmentation is the increased opportunity for contact among humans, domestic livestock and wildlife. This may result in increased transmission of zoonotic and anthropozoonotic diseases."
"It seems intuitive that extinctions resulting in fewer species of host animals should decrease the number of potential zoonotic pathogens and thus the incidence of VBZDs. Several scientists have suggested that high biodiversity is causally related to high levels of infectious disease, both locally and regionally. Indeed, some highly specific pathogens are likely to disappear with their hosts. Nevertheless, extinction and biodiversity loss may have some counterintuitive affects on the incidence of some VBZDs. Extinctions will occur selectively with habitat and dietary specialists being affected first. Meanwhile more opportunistic, generalist species may not only survive but thrive in the absence of competition from specialists. In their study of climate change and altitudinal migration in Yosemite National Park, Moritz et al. found that opportunistic small mammal species (those that were short-lived and had more litters per year) were more likely to expand their range upward than were their long-lived, less fecund counterparts. The host species for most of the known rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever viruses that affect humans are opportunistic species. Although it is possible that this pattern is due, at least in part, to sampling error (diseases associated with anthropophilic species would be the first to come to our attention), the pattern could be the logical consequence of several characteristics of opportunistic species (high vagility, rapid growth, early reproduction, high fecundity, and capacity to sustain high population densities that are conducive to the transmission of pathogens) that would facilitate the evolution and maintenance of pathogens. Further, decreases in the species diversity of potential host assemblages have been associated with increased prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens in host populations both for vector-borne diseases and for nonvector-borne zoonoses. Thus, selective extinctions associated with climate change can result in a net increase in the risk of some zoonotic infections in both wildlife and humans"
"The loss of biodiversity can affect the transmission of infectious diseases by changing: (1) The abundance of the host or vector. For plants, seeding experimental fields with plant species that are not hosts for fungal pathogens decreased threefold the pathogen load of species that are hosts, apparently by reducing host density through competition. On the other hand, a greater diversity of host species can sometimes increase pathogen transmission by increasing the abundance of vectors."
"The loss of biodiversity can affect the transmission of infectious diseases by changing: ... (2) The behaviour of the host, vector or parasite. In a more diverse community, one of the parasitic worms that causes schistosomiasis (which infects 200 million people worldwide) is more likely to end up in an unsuitable intermediate host. This can reduce the probability of subsequent infection of humans by 25–99%. For hantavirus in Utah, USA, rodent hosts on more diverse plots are more likely to come in contact with heterospecific mammals and less likely to come in contact with conspecifics, reducing the probability of transmission of the virus. In principle, higher diversity could influence behaviours with a resulting increase in disease transmission or could alter the evolutionary dynamics of virulence and transmission pathways."
"The loss of biodiversity can affect the transmission of infectious diseases by changing: ... (3) The condition of the host or vector. In experimental rice fields in China, rice plants in genetically diverse mixtures had drier leaves because the mixture changed microclimatic conditions. As a consequence, infection with rice blast fungus was less prevalent in diverse fields. Genetically diverse plantings can also lead to induced resistance in host plants because they are exposed to similar pathogens that are specialists on the other cultivars."
"However, in recent years, a consistent picture has emerged—biodiversity loss tends to increase pathogen transmission and disease incidence. This pattern occurs across ecological systems that vary in type of pathogen, host, ecosystem and transmission mode (Table 1). As an example, West Nile virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus for which several species of passerine birds act as hosts. Three recent studies detected strong correlations between low bird diversity and increased human risk or incidence of West Nile encephalitis in the United States. Communities with low avian diversity tend to be dominated by species that amplify the virus, inducing high infection prevalence in mosquitoes and people, while communities with high avian diversity contain many species that are less competent hosts. For hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a directly transmitted zoonotic disease, correlational and experimental studies have shown that a lower diversity of small mammals increases the prevalence of hantaviruses in their hosts, thereby increasing risk to humans (Box 2). Diversity has a similar effect for plant diseases, with species losses increasing the transmission of two fungal rust pathogens that infect perennial rye grass and other plant species."
"Biodiversity loss can clearly increase transmission if it reduces predation and competition on reservoir hosts, thereby increasing their density."
"The loss of species can increase encounter rates between pathogens and hosts, as in the Schistosoma example, when the lost species are not hosts for the pathogen. But if the lost species are indeed hosts capable of transmission, this declining diversity could also reduce the total number of hosts, thereby decreasing transmission if all else remains equal. Certainly reductions in the number of hosts can reduce the number of vectors and also their infection prevalence, but empirical examples are relatively rare, in part because the issue has been neglected, and also because all else rarely remains equal. For example, the loss of hosts can cause compensatory increases in the abundances of other hosts, such that total host abundance changes little relative to total host abundance in more diverse communities. Even when total host abundance does decline in less diverse systems, differences in host quality among species can alter simple correlations between host abundance and infection risk."
"Pathogen transmission is not always a function of host density. For example, the number of infectious bites delivered by highly mobile vectors like mosquitoes can be independent of the density of the host population. Transmission of directly transmitted pathogens like hantaviruses can also be independent of host density if transmission involves behavioural encounters, for example, aggressive interactions between rodents, and if the frequency of these encounters does not vary much with host density. In systems like these, the loss of host species can actually increase transmission if the lost hosts are suboptimal for parasite development and reproduction; this is because these suboptimal hosts absorb pathogens but are poor at transmitting them."
"In sum, reducing biodiversity can increase disease transmission when the lost species are either not hosts for the pathogen or are suboptimal ones. For pathogens for which transmission is a function of host density, loss of diversity is most likely to increase transmission if the loss causes an increase in the density of competent hosts. The number and diversity of examples of pathogens for which species loss leads to increases in total transmission suggests that these conditions are frequently met."
"The loss of particular species in a community clearly has the potential to increase disease transmission. But does reducing diversity itself increase transmission, or is increased transmission the consequence of the removal of particular species? The answer depends on how species composition changes as richness changes. For example, if those host species most responsible for amplifying the pathogen tend to persist or even thrive as biodiversity is lost, then disease risk will consistently increase as biodiversity declines. On the other hand, if amplifying species tend to disappear as biodiversity declines, then biodiversity loss will tend to reduce disease risk. These hypothetical possibilities indicate the importance of understanding both the non-random sequences by which species are lost from communities, and whether the species that tend to occur only in more species-rich communities tend to amplify or buffer pathogen transmission."
"For plants, species that are fast-growing and nutrient-rich with relatively high metabolic rates—characteristics of ‘weedy’ species—can be more competent hosts for arthropod vectors and plant pathogens than those with less weedy traits. Plants with these weedy traits are also more likely to become more abundant when plant diversity declines. Consequently, the very species that have traits permitting persistence in degraded and species-poor ecosystems are also more likely to carry high pathogen and vector burdens. A similar pattern may occur in vertebrates—resilience in the face of disturbances that cause biodiversity loss, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, is facilitated by life-history features such as high reproductive output and intrinsic rates of increase. Vertebrates with these features tend to invest minimally in some aspects of adaptive immunity; we hypothesize that this may make them more competent hosts for pathogens and vectors"
"Potential mechanisms by which land-use changes can affect pathogen dynamics and emergence. The complexity of mechanisms by which changes in host-pathogen dynamics can result in emergence is illustrated here with respect to land-use change as a risk factor for disease emergence. Land-use change could result in pathogen emergence by any of the following factors, which may affect reservoir dynamics or host-reservoir contact patterns: (1) demographic host release arising from reduction of competitor and/or predator species, resulting in competitive release and an increased density of the most competent host for a pathogen, (2) the fence effect, whereby habitat fragmentation restricts dispersal and leads to unnaturally high densities and hence infection rates, (3) reduction of species diversity leading to a relative increase in alternative, more competent hosts, (4) a reduction in the genetic diversity, which may increase opportunities for EIDs with knock-on effects on the equitability of higher trophic levels, (5) enrichment of nutrient status (by pollution or agricultural crop presence, or fertiliser), which may favour certain species that specialise on such resources, (6) elimination of biodiversity creating vacant niches for invasive species, which has been suggested as a factor in the emergence of non-polio enteroviruses following elimination of polio and (7) the establishment of secondary contact zones, in which pathogens introduced into novel environments have the opportunity to come into contact with closely related but previously geographically isolated pathogens. ... pathogen recombination in secondary animal contact zones may prove to be a rich source of novel zoonotic pathogens."
"Evidence suggests that through altered habitat structure and changes to resource availability, urbanization results in significant changes to the structure of wildlife communities, which are subsequently characterized by low biodiversity with proportional increases in abundance of certain generalist species. From a landscape-scale perspective, this results in a declining trend in species richness from rural areas to urban centers (biotic homogenization) with synanthropic species occurring at higher densities in urban and suburban environments than less-disturbed areas. Not surprisingly, such profound changes in trophic structure will have epidemiological consequences for pathogens within these communities, and as a general rule, declining host biodiversity should be matched by a loss in parasite diversity, thus reducing the pathogen pool and with it the risk of novel disease emergence."
"Increases in synanthropic species population density can elevate contact rates (through changes in host ranging patterns and densities), and thus increase the risk of pathogen transmission via direct contact and orofecal routes. Fragmentation of these populations, in contrast, can result in genetic bottlenecks and subsequently reduced effective immune responses. As host diversity decreases along gradients of urbanization, many pathogens are lost, but some (notably those in the hosts that remain in low diversity communities) can increase as a result of increased host abundance (termed the dilution effect)."
"Urbanization and agricultural expansion have greatly changed biological communities, reducing vertebrate species diversity in many habitats. While land use influences disease in myriad ways, researchers have focused on determining whether erosion of biodiversity will lead to an increase or decrease in disease risk—hypotheses called the ‘dilution effect’, and ‘amplification effect’, respectively. The name dilution effect originates from the mechanism proposed for the Lyme disease system; the addition of less competent host species (birds, raccoons, opossums and skunks) to communities consisting of highly competent hosts (white-footed mice, eastern chipmunks and shrews) is hypothesized to ‘dilute’ the transmission of the Lyme disease bacterium to larval ticks by these species, thereby reducing infection prevalence in nymph ticks. A suite of mechanisms has been proposed to explain how diversity (usually of hosts, but possibly also of vectors or microbiota, and measured in a variety of ways; figure 1) could influence transmission and result in either a dilution or amplification effect. These mechanisms include alterations in host and vector contact rates, abundance, vital rates and infectiousness (figure 1, beige box with star). For each mechanism, either dilution or amplification can occur as host composition and diversity changes. Anthropogenically altered habitats tend to have fewer large predators, smaller-bodied species, and more introduced species than undisturbed habitats. The traits of species, including their contact rates, their infectiousness for each pathogen, and their impact on other host and vector species will determine whether they are amplification or dilution hosts. Determining whether increasing biodiversity will result in dilution or amplification requires data from multiple pathogen systems, and multiple studies of the same pathogen system to understand how geographical and ecological variation influence transmission."
"These interactions between people and wildlife have led to more general assertions about the effects of biodiversity on exposure to infectious diseases. The dilution-effect hypothesis attributes increased infection risk to decreases in biodiversity, which implies that conservation of natural landscapes that serve as habitats to endangered species may reduce infectious disease risk to humans. However, evidence also supports the amplification effect, which points to tropical regions as the source of a disproportionate number of infectious diseases due to their biodiversity, presence of viable vectors and a number of species known to be reservoirs of pathogens that can infect humans. While these two perspectives both have supportive evidence, when and why different levels of biodiversity, host composition or changes to landscape depress or attenuate disease is probably linked to human interaction with different landscape types that are in different stages of transition. Therefore, the history and nuance of human land use in an area may have more impact on whether or not decreasing biodiversity results in infectious disease emergence."
"Genetic diversity dictates adaptability. We should anticipate widespread physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations with land-use change, and inevitable consequences for disease emergence. Geography and landscapes have long been known to play a critical role in disease, indeed the earliest disease maps by Finke and Humboldt date from the Early Victorian Period. Hence, we can anticipate that landscape changes will fundamentally alter existing ecosystem networks. Changes at the landscape level, such as isolation due to habitat fragmentation, counter the trend of more highly connected systems. However, an increase in isolated systems may lead to increased genetic drift and introduce new vulnerabilities from founder effects and genetic bottlenecks. These refugia and biological corridors become hotspots for disease transmission as organisms are crowded out of the human landscape and stressed by reduced resource availability."
"Although high host diversity often reduces pathogen transmission for existing diseases, some researchers have postulated that high host diversity might increase the probability of disease emergence by providing a large source of potential zoonotic pathogens. Both vertebrate and parasite diversity tend to be higher at low rather than high latitudes, leading to the hypothesis that emergence rates of human infectious diseases will be positively correlated with vertebrate diversity and negatively correlated with latitude. Evidence pertaining to this hypothesis is equivocal."
"Jones et al. found that the emergences of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife and of vector-borne pathogens were not significantly associated with latitude, but that emergence events of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife hosts were significantly, positively correlated with wildlife species richness. However, this correlation was quite weak, with wildlife species richness explaining only between 0.8% and 1.3% of the spatial variation in emergence. In contrast, human population density, a primary driver of biodiversity loss, was positively correlated with disease emergence, explaining 54% of the spatial variation in EIDs."
"Biodiversity should not be considered inherently beneficial, particularly when considered without regard to community composition. Abandoned areas and unmanaged greenspace have been found to harbor greater biodiversity than managed greenspace, but unmaintained areas can proffer greater harborage of commensal pests, including pathogen vectors. Biodiversity thus can be an indicator of potential hazards rather than valued services. This sentiment is well reflected in management of abandoned or depopulated areas (e.g., mowing), which often aims to constrain rather than enhance diversity. Biodiversity may be deliberately suppressed when real or perceived risks exceed benefits to human health and well-being, and management interventions intended to reduce risk may iteratively reinforce (i.e., via species removal) rather than restore biodiversity. Outcomes of abandonment could very well run contrary to increasingly contentious “biodiversity protects against disease” paradigm, which emphasizes the potential for a dilution effect (and the related phenomenon of zooprophylaxis) to lower transmission rates in humans by diverting transmission to other less competent hosts. A dilution effect may occur if an increase in faunal diversity reduces the assemblage of transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts; thus the probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts declines and the abundance of infected vectors is also lowered. This assumes, however, that the total abundance of vectors in a system does not vary. Critics of the “dilution effect” paradigm argue that the likelihood of dilution or amplification of disease transmission depends more on community composition than shifts in diversity."
"Zoonotic infectious disease emergence also can be viewed as a consequence of socioecological disruption of natural host-pathogen interactions (Figure 3), where relationships that regulate and stabilize relative abundance break down. From this, we can posit that heterogeneous or asymmetric community (re)assembly in times or areas of urban transition, particularly under conditions involving land use change, can foster disease emergence (Table 1). This is consistent with evidence suggesting that disease dynamics may be highly heterogeneous in both space and time, especially in multiple host and vector systems with varying competency levels, where increased abundance of a particular host (or subset of hosts) may result in amplification rather than dilution. The net effect of host diversity on disease emergence thus can become a function of vector versus host abundance. Due to the potential complexity of these systems, individual relationships between vector(s) and host(s) become crucial to predicting outcomes, therefore diversity measures alone may not predict disease transmission as accurately as other measures of community composition in counter-urbanizing cities"
