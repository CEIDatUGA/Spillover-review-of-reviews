"Domestication of animals, clearing of land for farming and grazing, and hunting of wildlife in new habitats, have resulted in zoonotic human infection with microorganisms that cause diseases such as rabies, echinococcosis, and the progenitors of measles and smallpox that had historically affected only animal populations through changes in contact and increased transmission opportunities from animals to people. As human societies have developed, each era of livestock revolution presented new health challenges and new opportunities for emergence of zoonotic pathogens."
"The extension of agricultural cultivation into forests may alter the existing zoonotic transmission cycles. The removal of forests and development of new farmland expose farmers and workers to disease-carrying arthropods and rodents. As humans encroach upon the forests, it becomes more likely that they will be exposed to new infectious agents."
"Habitat change, in the form of deforestation, extensive land use, agricultural development and alterations in water storage and irrigation habits, provide new niches for vectors. Deforestation and transformation of forests to grazing land, agricultural areas, human settlements or open areas, result in significant alterations in the environment and changes in the composition of vectors, and therefore, the introduction of new pathogens"
"When host ecology changes, it may result in increased contact between primary and secondary host species, providing opportunities for multihost evolution. In humans, relevant ecological changes include altered local demographics, changing travel or immigration patterns, intensified agricultural practices, changing land-use patterns and encroachment into wildlife habitat, climate change in human occupied areas, and range expansion of virus vectors or reservoirs. The reciprocal transmission of viruses following increased interspecies contact rates may select for virus variants with increased fitness in one or both species."
"Human activities associated with urbanization and agriculture can also have significant impacts on species abundances. Such impacts on host and vector population densities can play an important role in both ecological and evolutionary dynamics affecting parasite prevalence. Extremely dense host populations increase the likelihood of parasite transmission, contributing to higher infection prevalence and increasing the potential for an epidemic. Developed land can support particularly high densities of some host species, which appears to have contributed to epidemics in several instances."
"Schrag and Wiener argued that changes in pathogen and/or host ecology are primarily responsible for the majority of emerging diseases and that those resulting from evolutionary changes alone are comparatively rare. ‘Ecological changes’ embrace a number of very different processes under the same umbrella: changes in agricultural practices, urbanisation, globalisation or climate change."
"Ecological changes, including those due to agricultural or economic development, are among the most frequently identified factors in disease emergence. Ecological factors usually precipitate emergence by placing people in contact with a natural reservoir or host, which harbours an existing infection that was previously unfamiliar to humans. This may occur either by increasing proximity or, often, by changing conditions to favour an increased population of the microbe or its natural host."
"Agricultural development, one of the most common ways in which people alter the environment and interact with it, is often a factor in disease emergence. Hantaan virus, the cause of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (Korean haemorrhagic fever), is generally considered responsible for at least 100,000 human cases of disease each year in the People’s Republic of China and has probably been known in Asia for centuries. The virus is a natural infection of the field mouse, Apodemus agrarius. The rodent flourishes in rice fields and people usually contract the disease during the rice harvest from contact with infected rodents. Junin virus, the cause of Argentine haemorrhagic fever, is an unrelated virus with a history remarkably similar to that of Hantaan. The conversion of grassland to maize cultivation apparently favoured a rodent that was the natural host for this virus, and human cases increased in proportion to the expansion of maize agriculture. Additional examples are likely to appear as new areas are placed under cultivation."
"Encroachment of human settlements and agriculture on natural ecosystems results in expansion of ecotones (transition zones between adjacent ecological systems), where species assemblages from different habitats mix. This provides new opportunities for pathogen spillover"
"Expansion of agriculture promotes encroachment into wildlife habitats, leading to ecosystem changes and bringing humans and livestock into closer proximity to wildlife and vectors, and the sylvatic cycles of potential zoonotic pathogens. This greater intensity of interaction creates opportunities for spillover of previously unknown pathogens into livestock or humans and establishment of new transmission cycles."
"Exponential growth in the human population has increased the food demand all over the world. Large areas are being converted to agricultural land."
"deforestation and agricultural development leading to human habitat expansion into natural foci of a viral infection"
"The population of the world has been constantly increasing, resulting in increased demands for food, including meat; the industrialization of animal raising for food purposes and the intensive husbandry systems applied have resulted in the development of vast animal reservoirs in which an infection can spread from one animal to another and then jump species...this is also the rule for the extensive, sanitarily challenged animal markets of the East. The need for increased livestock production also leads to the expansion of farming in previously non-inhabited areas, through deforestation for farm development or common breeding areas for livestock and wildlife species carrying a disease"
"Human intrusion in any ecosystem is disruptive, and the resulting disequilibrium may create a conservatory for zoonotic agents: deforestation is the most typical procedure implicated, drastically altering the geological, hydrological and biological characteristics of a given space, often replacing it with plantations with different ecological correlations, grazing fields, or rice plantations, or even new-built suburban housing. In each case, changes in the synthesis of the local fauna may result in significant increases in the population of a definite zoonotic agent host, which in turn may increasingly come into contact with humans"
"modifications of our environment brought by industrialization, such as deforestation and reforestation or the development of dams and agriculture, change ecosystems and their relations with humans. Dams increase arthropod populations; cultivated land attracts animals"
"settlement and extension of agricultural land into wildlife habitat may also increase exposure to zoonotic disease"
"The fate and transport of pathogens associated with waterborne disease are impacted by both climate and land-use change. Agricultural and livestock practices lead to waterborne disease exposure through direct contamination of water supplies...This combination of land clearing and grazing ruminants with no buffer zones to protect waterways provides a widespread ecological setup for human infection...The combination of more extreme precipitation patterns associated with climate change and the continued expansion of animal husbandry may be a setup for growing numbers of waterborne disease outbreaks, particularly in parts of the world where there is little water filtration infrastructure to insulate populations from this risk."
"ecological disturbance appears to favor disease transmission. Although there are certainly exceptions, more often than not, disruption of historical land cover through deforestation, dams and irrigation, agricultural practices, or livestock management practices seems to lead to increased disease exposure"
"Many human land-use activities, including agriculture, irrigation, hunting, deforestation, and urban expansion, can cause or increase the risk of zoonotic and food- and water-borne diseases. For example, one consequence of urban sprawl and deforestation is that wildlife may increasingly need to find new habitats in urban or abandoned environments, which could lead to increased human exposures to infectious pathogens."
"It is most probable that recurrent cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens, without further establishment in the human population, occurred also increasingly frequently as agriculture progressed. These recurrent events may have been favored by the adaptation and evolution of commensal species, such as rodents and anthropophilic insect vectors, which, in addition to domesticated animals, may have created successful bridges between wild animal reservoirs and humans. The destruction of wild lands, with the ceaseless plowing of land and chopping of forests made by African farmers, attracted rats, mice, ticks, and fleas to live closer to humans, and provided ideal breeding habitats for mosquitoes"
"Destruction of natural habitat for agricultural purposes has been associated with rodent colonization and population expansion that favored the cross-species transmission of these novel pathogens to the human species"
"in much of the world, small-scale livestock rearing continues, but in the contexts of changing land use, climate change, urbanization, and crowding. Small-scale animal agriculture activities may involve deforestation to create animal pasture areas as well as to compensate for movements of people and animals from more rural areas to rapidly growing cities. As a result of these rapid transitions, people in large cities may have close contact with animals through live-animal (wet) markets or because other residents are raising small-scale poultry or ruminants inside or close to their households, creating a low-biosecurity setting for both humans and animals."
"Environmental modification is the main driver of wildlife spillover into human environments and includes deforestation, city development, mining, and dams. Deforestation is a major factor in the spillover of wildlife zoonoses. In the last 10 years, 13 million hectares of forests were cleared per year globally, compared with 16 million hectares per year in the 1990s. While deforestation has slowed, it still occurs at a high rate, reducing the natural habitat available for native animals. Much of this land is converted into farmland or city development. By reducing the natural habitats, native animals are forced into closer contact with domestic animals and humans, which has led to disease spillover from wildlife to humans and domestic animals, but also from domestic animals to wildlife."
"because human activity often decreases biodiversity, areas with high diversity often are areas with lower human presence, and thus are at lower risk due to lower human exposure to novel pathogenic hazards. If human activity increases—increasing exposure—humans in these areas may experience higher risk due to the high hazards present. This risk could also be increased further by disruption of local ecosystems and reduction of local biodiversity"
"the emergence of all major groups of emerging infectious diseases correlates strongly with human population density, supporting the hypothesis that disease emergence is driven by largely anthropogenic changes, such as the expansion of agriculture, travel routes, and trade, and changes in land use. Finally, the emergence of zoonotic pathogens of wildlife origin (which have dominated the pandemics of the past 100 years) correlates strongly with both human density and the global distribution of wildlife biodiversity."
"Anthropogenic influences such as expanding agriculture or urbanization can markedly change historic nidus dynamics by altering patch size and expanding ecotonal areas, thereby juxtaposing reservoir hosts, domestic animals, and human hosts to vector populations and enhancing tangential transmission...In vast monocultural agricultural settings, farmsteads effectively function as epidemiological islands, bringing nesting/roosting avian hosts and nocturnally questing mosquitoes together in time and space...This concept also applies to small communities within agroecosystems or to parkland or wetlands within or adjacent to urban continuums"
"For zoonoses, the increase in ecotonal areas has been associated with residences and associated landscaping becoming interspersed among climax and subclimax vegetation or within agroecosystems, especially monocultures such as rice. As indicated above, these fragmented landscapes bring reservoir hosts, vectors, and humans together, enhancing amplification and the risk for tangential transmission."
"Finally, the role of environmental change, a global problem, is important in dissemination of infectious diseases. There are multiple ways by which environmental changes could contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases: natural disasters (e.g. flood, drought, earthquake, and famine), deforestation, global warming, and climate change. Deforestation, road construction, irrigation, intensive agriculture and animal production systems, uncontrolled spread of human habitat, lack of public health and contamination are examples of environmental changes caused by human activity that facilitate the emergence of infectious diseases. Zoonotic transmission of infectious diseases is facilitated by encroachment of human habitation and the loss of niche environments."
"Anthropogenic factors bring human and domestic animal populations into increasing contact with wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. For example, in Malaysia, intensive management of pig production in farms located in fruit bat habitat led to the spillover of Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus for which these bats serve as a reservoirs. Similarly, logging routes carved into primary forest have provided easier access to hunters in search of animals to eat or sell. The trade in bushmeat, which brings wild animals from geographically disparate habitats into contact with each other and with people, has led to the spillover of several important zoonotic viruses including HIV, Ebola, and SARS. As human populations continue to increase, so do these anthropogenic pressures on wildlife habitat and populations. The result is likely to be continued spillover of new zoonotic pathogens into human populations, and perhaps even an increase in spillover rates, reflecting increases in these anthropogenic drivers of emergence."
"Logging in tropical regions is paralleled by the process of urban sprawl in developed countries, and the removal of natural wildlife habitat. The impact of this process on wildlife diversity, ecology, and habitat quality has been studied extensively by ecologists. The impact of this process on human health has also been well-studied, but largely regarding the impact of pollution and stress on human health and welfare. However, recent work by disease ecologists has shown a strong connection between urban sprawl, habitat fragmentation, the loss of biodiversity and increased risk of zoonotic disease spillover to people."
"It has long been recognized that many diseases of humans and their livestock have reservoirs in wildlife and that arthropod vectors are often involved in their transmission. A Russian academician proposed the concept of the “natural nidality” of transmissible disease in 1939. Pavlovsky was concerned with diseases which occur naturally in wildlife and are often transmitted to humans when they enter the territory shared by the wild reservoir host and the arthropod vectors."
"Other environmental and socioeconomic factors that bring humans into closer contact with potentially new pathogens (for example, forest clearing for agriculture, wildlife hunting) may also contribute to this pattern. Indeed, almost half of the zoonotic diseases that have emerged in humans since 1940 resulted from changes in land use, from changes in agricultural or other food production practices, or from wildlife hunting (Fig. 2). These human activities increase rates of contact between humans and animals, which may be a critical factor underlying spillover."
"Deforestation and development of natural habitats have been seen on a global scale to accommodate intensification of agriculture and living areas for humans. As a result, ecologic habitats have been disrupted, reservoir abundance has changed, and transmission dynamics have been altered. Reduced host abundance may force vectors to seek alternative hosts, increasing opportunities for disease transmission, as demonstrated by increases in human cases of Lyme borreliosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fevers, and anaplasmosis. Development of forests to provide rubber plantations in Malaysia has been correlated with increases in schistosomiasis. Wildlife may modify feeding practices as a consequence of changing land use, bringing them closer to humans and livestock. This modification was suggested to have been instrumental in the Nipah virus outbreak that affected pigs and humans in Malaysia in 1999. Nipah virus persists as a serious problem in many rural areas of Bangladesh and India, where infected bats living near human dwellings, urinate in date palm sap, which is later consumed raw by humans."
"As suggested above, land use change and agriculture have been related to the emergence of new pathogens, with the expansion of the human/economic system into previously pristine environments providing consequent exposure to a pool of known and unknown pathogens. Changes in farming practices, such as movement from rural to peri-urban and urban areas, are likely to affect pathogen ecology and its transmissibility to the urban population. Habitat destruction has played an important but often complex role in the spread/emergence of infectious diseases."
"Human population growth and modern agricultural practices have enticed human settlers into clearing patches within ecosystems of maximally high biodiversity, such as tropical rain forests, converting substantial areas into cultivated fields and pastures. Commercial farming operations inserted into clearings in forest habitats juxtapose and intermingle humans and livestock with native animal populations, and, coincidentally, with whatever zoonotic pathogens exist within these natural nidi. In many instances, the cleared land has been used for irrigated agriculture, resulting in an increase in vector-borne diseases such as JEV as mosquitoes and water bird H R s are brought in close proximity to domestic pigs in nearby villages. Dams are built to maintain water for human consumption and for use in irrigated agriculture, but they too may lead to increased zoonotic disease emergence as they provide the milieu for intermingling mosquito vectors and reservoir hosts of arboviruses as well as the spread of other diseases such as schistosomiasis."
"As a first category, pathogens may enter in closer contact with novel host types, be it humans, domestic animals or wildlife. Increased pathogen spill-over may result from this mixing of species and eventually, given progressive exposure of the new host to the ‘new’ pathogen, generate a ‘species jump’ with sustained transmission in the novel host species. Examples of drivers comprise bush or wild meat hunting and consumption, deforestation and logging, other forms of human encroachment of forests and game reserves, and increased interspecies contacts at the wildlife/agriculture interface, between humans and their pet animals, and within food animal production systems."
"In most cases, the main driver behind the emergence of a pathogen in a new host is increased contact between different host types. A set of global factors changes ecological landscapes worldwide and brings animals and humans in closer contact. Microbial reservoirs with potentially hazardous disease agents circulate in non-human primates, wild carnivores, birds, bats and rodents. Humans may become infected encroaching forest and game reserves, including hunting for and consumption of wild meat. Interspecies contact rates have gone up considerably also as a result of the steep recent and ongoing growth in human population and increases in food animal production. Wildlife migration can facilitate species jumps to domestic animals and humans. The pressures on the natural resource base forces wildlife into farming and urban landscapes, enhancing species mixing."
"From an ecosystem perspective, anthropogenic pressures result in the fragmentation of natural biomes, leaving a composite mix of different habitats. Remnant fragments that are representative of the original biome can be thought of as patches that exist within a matrix of habitats that are unlike the original. Interfaces between patches and the matrix exist at local-scales, and can be classified as ecotones – edges or transitionary zones between adjacent ecological systems where ‘biophysical factors, biological activity and ecological evolutionary processes are concentrated and intensified’. It has been suggested that by expanding ecotonal areas through interspersing human landscapes such as farmland and settlements with natural landscapes, anthropogenic influences can alter pathogen niches by bringing together humans, vectors, and reservoir hosts (wildlife or domestic animals), thus increasing contact and the risk of transmission. Such landscape changes can be compounded by alterations in wildlife species interaction and abundance (e.g., host ecological traits); rodents can undergo ecological release at forest interfaces being attracted to farmland and human settlements for resources and suitable breeding habitat, and human settlements might provide suitable breeding habitat for mosquitos and birds (important arthropod vectors and reservoirs for West Nile virus). Evidence for an association between disease emergence and ecotones has been documented for several zoonoses with wildlife reservoirs, including yellow fever, Nipah virus encephalitis, influenza, rabies, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, cholera, Escherichia coli infection and African trypanosomiasis. In urbanized areas such as cities, tangential variation in land use from rural–periurban–urban areas would be expected to generate a wide variety of ecotones on micro- and macrospatial scales. Ecotones can therefore represent important local-scale ecological interfaces within which zoonotic agents circulate and infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans."
"Developing countries in tropical regions are places of rapid human population growth, frequently accompanied by urbanization, development and economically driven industries and activities. These processes frequently change accessibility of localities and populations, increasing mixing between previously disconnected groups and affecting the viable transmission of infectious agents. Ongoing trends in rural–urban migration and the proliferation of cheap means of increasing mobility, as with the availability of motorcycles, suggest that contact heterogeneity at the landscape level is likely to intensify even as people make further inroads into formerly wild or sparsely populated spaces such as tropical forests. Markets may incentivize bushmeat and wildlife trade in these areas as well, which can increase people's contact with potential reservoirs and promote conditions favourable to infectious disease transmission. Accessibility, mobility and connection between disparate communities can be affected by new development projects. The construction of a new road in rural Ecuador, for example, increased the incidence of enteric infections, and villages with greater access to the new road were eight times more likely to become infected. Urbanization has also been cited as a key contributor to the rapid expansion of dengue virus across global tropical and subtropical regions over the past 40 years. The influx of human populations into urban centres has brought people in increasing contact with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which have become fully adapted to urban environments."
"The Green revolution brought widespread alterations to global biogeochemistry. Accompanying changes in agricultural practice altered the agrarian landscape—an important habitat in terms of both surface area and productivity. In this context, biogeochemistry is particularly relevant to health, given anthropogenic modification of global processes. Following World War II, the industrial efficiencies of bomb factories were adapted to production of agricultural fertilizers. As a consequence, ecological stoichiometry was radically altered. In geological time, this is a short-term experiment and it is not yet clear what the long-term implications will be for global-scale ecosystem processes. Indeed, the fertilizers manufactured are typically nutrients that limit productivity. Hence it is inevitable that these will impact abundance and distribution of organisms, including disease hosts and vectors."
"Also, changes in living conditions, including urbanization, encroachment on forested areas and changes in animal husbandry all encourage the emergence of new pathogens. Natural disasters, war and other pressures causing movements of displaced persons also contribute to the emergence of pathogens in new areas and re-emergence of old ones. The exponential increase in both volume and distance of air travel means that Britons are at increasing risk of encountering and importing infections from abroad."
