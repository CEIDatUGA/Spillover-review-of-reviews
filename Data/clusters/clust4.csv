"Changes in abundance of animal hosts can strikingly affect disease incidence in people. A decrease in the abundance of a preferred animal host can cause an arthropod vector to shift feeding patterns to human beings, leading to a disease outbreak."
"Changes in climate and temperatures affect the distribution of vectors and the effectiveness of pathogen transmission by vectors. The atmospheric composition changes constantly as a result of human activities, particularly combustion of fossil fuels. This results in the significant increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and reduced plant water loss through evapotranspiration. Therefore, plants produce more foliage with the same amount of water, increasing the density of plant foliage for extended periods in the year and providing more favorable microclimates for insect vectors"
"Major climate events such as El Nino trigger the emergence of disease outbreaks...Increased rainfall favors the growth of mosquito population resulting in an increased incidence of mosquito-borne diseases."
"Satellite data have shown that urban and industrial air pollution suppresses precipitation...Pollution associated alterations in rainfall may alter vector habitats, and therefore, the distribution of associated pathogens."
"The global spread of infectious agents by vectors is affected by natural factors such as movement of vectors by wind, carriage on transport hosts like migrating birds, and by means of transportation (e.g. flying, walking)"
"The most notable manifestations have been the increasing climatic conditions initiated by changes in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific, known as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. In the summer of 1990, an El Niño event occurred, which in turn led to a period of prolonged drought in many regions of the Americas and the emergence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Conversely, a sudden reversal in sea temperature in the summer of 1995 resulted in heavy rainfalls, especially in Columbia, resulting in resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and equine encephalitis."
"Vector-borne diseases are judged as highly sensitive to climatic conditions, although the evidence for climatic change and altered epidemiology of vector-borne disease is generally regarded as particularly sensitive to temperature. Even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate affect as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly as the season progresses. "
"Climatic change can also bring about altered vector distributions if suitable areas for expansion become newly available. Again, the effect may be disproportionate, particularly if the vector transmits disease to human or animal populations without pre-existing levels of acquired immunity with the result that those clinical cases are more numerous and potentially more severe. Increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations in either rainfall or temperature favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes."
"The relentless change inflicted by humans on habitats in the name of progress has also had a marked effect on rodent habitats. Outbreaks of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States have been clearly associated with abnormal periods of drought or rainfall, leading to unusually rapid increases in rodent numbers. Of all species of mammals, rodents are among the most adaptable to comparatively sudden changes in climate and environmental conditions. Small climatic changes can bring about considerable fluctuations in population size, inhabiting desert and semidesert areas, particularly in food quantity and quality. "
"Among all species of mammals, members of the family Muridae have been the most successful and are found in almost all habitats. This family has species that are the natural hosts of almost all arenaviruses and hantaviruses. As noted above, rodents are highly susceptible to climate and ecological change, resulting in variable population numbers. "
"Host utilization, host range, virus life history, transmission routes, and kindred subjects are all aspects of virus ecology; that is, interactions between viruses and the biotic and abiotic environment. Environmental heterogeneity across space and time affects the incidence of disease in vectors and reservoir hosts and can lead to emergence events."
"Humans also indirectly alter associations of hosts, parasites and vectors, primarily via anthropogenic climate change and land-use change. For example, increased temperatures at higher latitudes and elevations allow parasites and their vectors to expand their range into communities where hosts are naive"
"Agriculture, especially irrigation cultivation, increased the risk of vector borne disease"
"‘Ecological changes’ embrace a number of very different processes under the same umbrella: changes in agricultural practices, urbanisation, globalisation or climate change. The latter is a factor of growing concern as it may affect the areas where primary agricultural production takes place, alter vector distribution and abundance, change the migration patterns of birds and other wildlife, and affect the survival time of pathogens outside the host. A common feature of all these processes is that they are largely a consequence of human activity."
"Water management activities may result in increased density of breeding sites for mosquitoes"
"Global warming is an ecological emergency, but its implications for human disease caused by infectious agents remains understudied: It is well known that the mosquito life cycle is affected by temperature, meaning that a slight (1–2C) increase in average summer temperature may allow mosquitoes to inhabit temperate zones, often carrying with them zoonotic agents for which they serve as vectors. Bird migration may be affected by global temperature alterations: birds seeking novel migratory routes may also transfer a novel zoonosis to a previously non-endemic area...zoonotic infections exhibit a tendency to move their ecological landscape westwards...and polewards, because of the gradual narrowing of the traditional temperate zones"
"Collectively, changes in land use and climate are altering the biological composition, structure, and complexity of much of the global land surface. They are altering temperature, precipitation patterns, soil moisture, biogeochemical cycles, nutrient concentrations, surface water chemistry, and exposure to sunlight. These parameters are often fundamental in defining the range and breeding habitat of numerous vectors, hosts, and pathogens, and as they change, we can expect changes in the density or presence of these organisms."
"Many infectious diseases are temperature sensitive as many vectors and pathogens are dependent upon permissive ambient conditions. There is thus a substantial body of research that collectively demonstrates that warming will increase the transmission of vector-borne diseases in the geographic ranges of their distribution...Changing temperature and precipitation patterns can affect the habitats and population growth of cold-blooded disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks, as well as the replication rates of infectious diseases within their hosts, and even the rates at which disease-carrying vectors bite humans"
"Climate change is also playing a role in the spread of helminth zoonoses by changing ranges of animals and habitats of helminth vectors such as mosquitoes as well as increasing survivability of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) by providing the right conditions of warm, moist soil resulting from the expansion of tropical and subtropical zones due to climate change."
"Of all the zoonotic helminths, filarial nematodes are the most likely to increase their areas of future transmission due to climate change and weather changes which will result in the expansion of the relevant insect vectors into new regions."
"The main driver of pathogen introductions in the past five decades—the accelerating increase in trade and travel—is well known. What is less discussed is that four centuries of trade and travel set the stage for many present pathogen introductions. In the 17th to 19th centuries, shipping traffic resulted in the transport of larvae of several important mosquito species"
"Increases in incidence can also result from changes in socioeconomic and human activities, such as expansion into risky new habitats for exploitation or dwelling, or land-cover change, such as reforestation of previously agricultural areas. Human infection with VBPs increases with the product of entomological risk (the abundance of infected vectors) and exposure of people to vectors, which can change independently and sometimes synergistically."
"increased transmission of VBPs with warming along the cold latitudinal and altitudinal edges of their present distribution...Expansions in the distribution of a disease might have disproportionate effects on public health if the newly exposed populations have little immunity."
"One underappreciated aspect of growing human populations, global land-use change, and the introduction of human commensal vectors is the selective pressure exerted on pathogens, causing them to evolve to take advantage of new environments, including hosts and vectors."
"More generally, the transmission of many VBPs is less efficient when the vector feeds on several hosts, only some of which can be infected by the pathogen."
"climate change will lead to more widespread and more abundant VBPs as more of the planet starts to closely resemble the tropics where VBPs are presently most abundant"
"Specifically, higher temperatures increase three aspects of transmission for vector-borne pathogens: vector biting rate, vector development rate, and pathogen replication (thereby reducing the extrinsic incubation period or the time between a vector feeding on an infected host and being able to transmit the pathogen). However, they frequently decrease a fourth, vector survival, especially when associated with moisture stress. As a result, increased temperatures might lead to increases or decreases in transmission depending on the relative effects of these factors."
"Ecosystem change brought about by the new climate is leading to new associations involving hosts, parasites and other biotic components of the ecosystem. Examples include new assemblages of host species, parasite species, parasites and other pathogens, as well as new associations resulting from altered host and parasite behavior, and altered ecological networks. For parasite zoonoses in people, the key associations are those that lead to human infection."
"There is considerable evidence that climate change has, and will increasingly have, a direct influence on the distribution of vectors of parasitic diseases (particularly arthropods), either directly or indirectly, by impacting on the distribution and availability of hosts and, thus, parasite transmission, leading to changes in both the distribution and the incidence of disease"
"The close relationship between pathogens and their tick vectors makes the pathogens susceptible to the abiotic factors affecting ticks...Bioclimatic threshold temperatures affect the transmission of TBDs"
"Ticks find their hosts either passively by questing on vegetation, waiting in a host’s nest or burrow or actively by moving toward more distant stimuli. Micro- and macroclimatic factors influence this behavior and are therefore likely to decrease or increase the human risk of becoming infected with a TBP."
"Disease risk is reduced by the presence of hosts with a low capacity to infect feeding vectors (incompetent reservoirs) which dilute the effect of competent reservoir hosts...In nature, this dilution effect is most likely supported by an increased biodiversity...increasing species richness, but not evenness, leads to a reduced disease risk, since dilution effects are most pronounced when alternative hosts have negative influences (e.g. predation or competition) on dominant reservoir hosts within the community."
"The contamination of tick habitats by increased environmental pollution with heavy metals from industry and cars can lead to exoskeleton abnormalities in ticks. Ticks bearing such cuticular anomalies are more susceptible to infection with a variety of TBPs, including a higher prevalence of multi-infection, while also showing behavioural changes, such as enhanced activity, that increase the risk of human infection"
"An increase in temperature in certain areas, leading to a hotter and drier climate, might limit the population density of ticks and thus the risk of TBPs"
"It seems rather that the anthropogenic related movement of host animals over long distances leads to the introduction of ticks to new areas. The massive translocation of livestock has already led to the introduction and geographical spread of ticks and their associated pathogens into new areas."
"Another aspect of increasing mobility is travel health. International travellers represent a group potentially at high risk of disease acquisition wherever they enter endemic areas, because they tend to have limited knowledge about health risks in the destination area and are easily exposed to tick-infested habitats"
"The effects of climate change on the epidemiology of mosquito-borne viral diseases are not easily predictable. Although cursory consideration might conclude that increases in temperature and rainfall will produce increased incidence of arboviral diseases, in fact the ecologic determinants of these diseases interact in complex ways...Extremely high temperatures can increase mosquito mortality, which could decrease arboviral disease transmission. Heavy rainfall can wash out mosquito breeding sites. Humans may seek refuge in air-conditioned buildings during heatwaves that might otherwise expose them to mosquito bites...Increasing temperatures can increase the transmission of arboviruses by decreasing the development time of mosquito vectors..., by decreasing the extrinsic incubation period, and by increasing the viral titer in mosquitoes"
"For both mosquito–human–mosquito transmission and bird–mosquito–human transmission, changes in human behavior, such as water storage, land use and irrigation, patterns of dwelling construction, use of air-conditioning, and intensity of mosquito control efforts all can interact with climate to alter the incidence of human disease."
"Ticks are restricted to geographic locations where climatic conditions are suitable for completion of their life cycles and changing climatic conditions (i.e., temperature and precipitation) may shift the geographic range and seasonal period of disease risk and alter transmission dynamics within endemic areas, thereby resulting in changes in spatial and temporal patterns of human disease...Time of onset of human illness and frequency of infection are both associated with seasonal changes in the abundance of host-seeking vector ticks. Because host-seeking phenology is strongly affected by temperature and precipitation, it is likely that climate change will alter the timing and duration of peak risk of exposure to tickborne pathogens."
"During unfavorable weather periods, nidus dimensions often contract to spatially delimited refugia that enable host and/or vector and pathogen persistence. Under permissive temperatures, moisture-related focus contraction actually may enhance host-vector contact and therefore transmission."
"Pathogen transmission seems to progress most effectively under warm temperatures, because vector populations increase rapidly in abundance and generation times are shortened; blood feeding and oviposition occur more frequently, increasing the frequency of host-vector contact; and rapid pathogen development within the vector shortens the duration of the extrinsic incubation period, thereby increasing the efficiency of transmission. Collectively, changes in these temperature-sensitive variables increase vectorial capacity or the force of transmission that, in part, determines the shape of amplification and epidemic curves and establishes the receptivity of new areas for pathogen invasion."
"Areas with high soil wetness and primary productivity during summer delineate areas suitable for mosquito production and for plants and insects, potential food items for bird populations. Areas with increased vector mosquito and avian abundance potentially have increased transmission of arboviruses such as WNV. On a fine scale, ecotones frequently are utilized by upland bird species such as mourning doves and house finches for roosting and nesting and by mosquitoes for flight paths and host seeking...ecotones seem to define areas of high risk for human infection."
"Vectors such as mosquitoes typically have short life cycles, rapid gonotrophic cycles, multiple blood meals during adult life, and therefore frequent, but intermittent, host contact."
"Long-distance movements of mosquitoes and arboviruses have been associated with storm fronts and prevailing wind patterns, resulting in the intercontinental dispersal of both vectors and pathogens"
"climatic changes may drive the emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne diseases in several ways: (i) poleward spread of vectors and vector-borne pathogens as climate warms in temperate zones and becomes more suitable for these species. This process may also be accompanied by poleward contraction of the most equatorial limits of these species if temperatures become too hot for them; (ii) greater likelihood and frequency of introduction and endemic establishment of tropical and subtropical vector-borne diseases into currently temperate regions by a combination of (a) rising temperatures in the receiving location, increasing vector and vector-borne pathogen survival; (b) increasing abundance of vectors and vector-borne pathogens in tropical and subtropical source locations; and (c) increasing rates of import of (particularly) tropical and subtropical vector-borne pathogens due to increased climate change-related human migration"
"Humidity impacts the time that vectors can spend in host and/or meal-seeking activity. Drier environments mean more frequent energy-expensive rehydration...this reduces the time spent seeking host meals and diverts finite energy sources away from host-meal finding, ultimately reducing the likelihood that vectors will survive to successfully feed on a host"
"A key determinant of the spatiotemporal occurrence of dipteran-borne pathogens is the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP is the time it takes for a pathogen ingested by the fly when it feeds on an infected human or animal to spread from the gut of the fly through the haemocoele to the salivary glands, from which the pathogen can then be released to infect another animal or human when the fly feeds again, which can involve simple pathogen multiplication and dissemination or complex sexual cycles. The speed with which EIP occurs depends on temperature: the warmer the temperature, the faster EIP occurs. If temperature conditions are too low, the EIP is longer than the average life expectancy of the fly and, therefore, pathogen transmission cycles cannot occur, even if vector populations are abundant. Also, at high temperatures, fly mortality rates may increase faster than the shortening of EIP, resulting in upper temperature limits for pathogen transmission"
"Changing seasonality may impact the dynamics of zoonotic pathogen transmission by changing the timings of vector seasonal activity and host demographic processes. This may be particularly important for tick-borne diseases because of the linkage of the phenology of transmission to phenology of tick development, and could alter the landscape of fitness of different pathogens and strains, perhaps causing either re-emergence events or the evolution of novel, pathogenic genotypes"
"A warming climate may also render temperate zones more susceptible to introduction and endemic establishment of tropical and/or subtropical vectors and vector-borne diseases introduced by travellers or trade products by allowing the greater survival of exotic vectors and permitting transmission cycles (by lowering the EIP) vectored by competent endemic vectors or introduced exotic species."
"In tropical regions, seasonal changes in disease risk are often attributable to the appearance of the ‘rainy season’ or (in Asia) the monsoon, which provides mosquito vectors with abundant pools for oviposition and larval maturation"
"In subtropical and temperate zones, warmer weather is associated with shorter insect generation times, and increased biting activity"
"The emergence and re-emergence of various infectious diseases is linked to regional as well as to global climatic changes. At present, global warming is about to reshape vegetation zones and can be expected to change the distribution and abundance of vector-borne infections. The probably best-known and most potent source of interannual climate variability are the El Niño-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), a continuous but irregular cycle of shifts in ocean and atmospheric conditions that affect the global climate. El Niño, Spanish for ‘the Child’ (and specifically the Christ child), causes changes in the risk of droughts, floods and tropical cyclones in different parts of the world and is generally linked to an increased impact of natural disasters on a global scale. The past 20 years have witnessed the two strongest El Niño events on historical record (1982–1983, 1997–1998), leading many authors to speculate that ENSO may be increasing as a result of global warming. Weather events and climatic changes can have a significant effect on insect and rodent populations, reproduction or mortality rates and can influence the overall abundance of these disease vectors."
"Climatic changes may also have an important impact on parasitic diseases, zoonotic or not. Small changes in absolute temperatures can have substantial effects on the transmission dynamics of protostrongylid lungworms and muscleworms (species of Parelaphostrongylus, Protostrongylus and Umingmakstrongylus), which cycle among the environment, gastropod intermediate hosts and ungulate definitive hosts in the most northern regions of the globe. Investigations of emerging infectious diseases associated with parasites in northern wildlife show that emergence of parasitic disease is linked to geographic expansion, host switching, resurgence due to climate change and newly recognised parasite species. Similarly, global warming will increase the geographical repartition of sandflies which transmit leishmaniasis or bartonellosis. In a simulation model looking at the potential effect of global warming on the geographic and seasonal distribution of Phlebotomus papatasi in southwest Asia, Cross and Hyams showed that ‘‘among 115 weather stations, 71 (62%) would be considered endemic with current temperature conditions; 14 (12%) additional stations could become endemic with an increase of 1 C; 17 (15%) more with a 3 C increase; and 12 (10%) more (all but one station) with a 5 C increase. In addition to increased geographic distribution, seasonality of disease transmission could be extended throughout 12 months of the year in 7 (6%) locations with at least a 3 C rise in temperature and in 29 (25%) locations with a 5 C rise”."
"Topography: Elevation and its effect on rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures has an important effect on the distribution of potential wildlife disease reservoirs and arthropod vectors. Where climate is seasonal there may be a vertical movement of susceptible animals across contour lines. Vertical and horizontal air movements caused by temperature changes and by topographic features may influence the movements of infectious agents and noxious chemicals. Many diseases thus have an altitudinal distribution."
"Water provides a habitat for many infectious disease agents, their hosts and vectors. Water can be a carrier of infectious diseases and may carry toxic substances, some of which may be of natural origin, like mercury or fluoride whereas others, like oil or pesticides, may be the result of human activities. ... The interfaces between temporarily flooded areas and the surrounding landscapes may thus become important epidemiological zones. Flood plains that occur regularly and seasonally in arid and semiarid zones are important epidemiological features and often provide seasonal foci of several reservoir hosts and vectors. In the dry season both wild and domestic animals may congregate in very large numbers at and around water sources. This provides an opportunity for the transmission of infectious disease amongst species that are normally spatially separated."
"If climate change is to affect the frequency of VBZDs through acting on nonhuman hosts, vectors, and pathogens, it is likely to act by one (or a combination) of four primary mechanisms: a) range shifts in host or vector distribution that bring these hosts and vectors into contact with new human populations; ..."
"If climate change is to affect the frequency of VBZDs through acting on nonhuman hosts, vectors, and pathogens, it is likely to act by one (or a combination) of four primary mechanisms: ... b) changes in the population density of the host or vector that would result in increased or decreased frequency of contact with humans or with other hosts and vectors; ..."
"If climate change is to affect the frequency of VBZDs through acting on nonhuman hosts, vectors, and pathogens, it is likely to act by one (or a combination) of four primary mechanisms: ... c) changes in the prevalence of infection by the pathogen in the host or vector population that would increase or decrease the frequency of human (or other host or vector) contact with an infected host or vector; ..."
"If climate change is to affect the frequency of VBZDs through acting on nonhuman hosts, vectors, and pathogens, it is likely to act by one (or a combination) of four primary mechanisms: ... d) changes in pathogen load brought about by changes in rates of pathogen reproduction, replication, or development in hosts or vectors that would affect the likelihood that a human (or other host or vector) contact would result in pathogen transmission."
"Range shifts: Geographic changes in the distributions of wildlife species in response to climate change are difficult to document because of the absence of current and historic data on distributions of many species and populations. Nevertheless, range shifts have been observed for a variety of taxa, including important mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors. These range shifts have generally been poleward and upward (toward higher elevations), and they have resulted in overall expansions, contractions, or no change in the total area occupied by a population or species. Altitudinal and latitudinal range shifts have occurred for Ixodes ricinus, the vector of the agents of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Europe, and these shifts are associated with (“association” as used throughout this review is not proof of causation) new foci of disease and an increase in incidence of TBE. Northerly range shifts also have been observed for Ixodes scapularis, a vector of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis in North America. Models indicate that this species will extend its range farther into Canada while contracting its southern range. ... Known and unknown tropical host and pathogen systems are likely to shift their ranges closer to subtropical and temperate population centers as climate changes at higher latitudes."
"Range shifts may not be restricted to latitudinal and elevational dimensions. Several host and vector species are restricted to specific habitat types. The frequency of occurrence of hosts, vectors, or pathogens in these habitat types helps to define relative risk of disease to humans associated with these habitats."
"Climate change has been associated with conditions that alter the carrying capacity of ecosystems for some plant or animal populations. Such changes can result in dramatic increases, or sometimes decreases, in host or vector population densities. Examples from vector-borne diseases are numerous. Populations of Aedes mosquitoes (vector for the agent of Rift Valley fever in East Africa) (Table 1) increase dramatically after periods of high rainfall associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Increases in mosquitoes and mosquito-borne malaria were associated with ENSO events in South America and southern Africa. Increasing temperatures also can decrease the development time of mosquitoes allowing greater population densities to be reached. Increased incidence of malaria was linked to precipitation and higher temperatures in Kenya and Madagascar. Conversely, reduced rainfall in Senegal and Niger was associated with decreases in malaria, presumably resulting from decreased mosquito reproduction."
"The effects of environmental extremes on vertebrate host populations can be pronounced. High summer temperatures have resulted in increased mortality of hosts, such as bats in tropical or subtropical areas or increased overwinter survivorship of species in temperate areas. After an ENSO event in 1997, investigators recorded increased rainfall, improved quality of vegetation, and increased population density of North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in the southwestern United States. These events preceded increased numbers of HPS cases in the area over 3 years. Increased rainfall was also associated with outbreaks of HPS in Paraguay and Panama. Similarly, human plague (a flea-borne zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis; Table 1) in the western United States was influenced by the effects of above-normal temperatures and status of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO resulted in precipitation increases that were believed to enhance small-mammal food resources and flea survival. Although less attention has been paid to decreases in host populations, lower rainfall is accompanied by decreasing populations of North American deer mice in the southwestern United States, whereas increasing rainfall during cold periods was associated with abrupt population declines in some ecosystems."
"The increases in host or vector populations discussed above can lead to increased frequency of contact between hosts or between hosts and vectors (density-dependent transmission) and increased prevalence of infection in host or vector populations."
"Prevalence of infection for other VBZDs might be increased by other mechanisms besides density-dependent transmission. Environmental changes that lead to increased stress in hosts can decrease host immune response, resulting in increased probability of infection as well as higher pathogen loads and increased pathogen shedding by a variety of host species ..."
"Temperatures can have profound effects on the development of pathogens and pathogen loads in arthropod vectors. Malaria parasites develop in mosquito vectors only within certain temperature ranges. Similarly, Y. pestis, the etiological agent of plague, develops and expresses biofilm efficiently only at temperatures < 28°C. Biofilm facilitates Y. pestis transmission by causing infected fleas to increase feeding attempts and regurgitate Y. pestis back into host animals during feeding."
"Recurrence of viral replication (recrudescence) under stress, including heat stress, has been documented for human viral diseases and is likely to occur within zoonotic host populations also. ... Although mechanisms for the reactivation of viral replication are poorly understood, stress-related immunosuppression has been suggested."
"Just as the interaction effects between various aspects of climate change (e.g., temperature and precipitation) must be considered to accurately predict the influence of climate on VBZDs, so too must the interactions between climate change and other anthropogenic and natural factors. Human activities facilitate host or vector range shifts by transporting hosts or vectors to new geographic areas, including new continents, as was the case with vectors of plague and West Nile virus and hosts of monkeypox in the United States. "
"Human migrations in response to climate change may make them more vulnerable to some VBZDs. "
"The role of agriculture in human disease may therefore have had at least three components : (a) changing the transmission ecology of pre-existing human pathogens; (b) increasing the success of pre-existing pathogen vectors, resulting in novel interactions between humans and wildlife ; (c) providing a stable conduit for human infection by wildlife diseases by means of domesticated animals."
"Climate change also effects evolution of pathogens, and where relevant, their vectors. Continual mutation and recombination events give rise to variants with altered levels of fitness to persist and spread. "
"On a global scale, climate change has been increasingly linked to instances of zoonotic disease emergence, with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) providing the largest interannual signal of climate variation. One hypothesized mechanism by which ENSO triggers increased incidence of zoonotic disease among humans, is through a chain of sequentially induced events referred to as a trophic cascade, ultimately leading to increased numbers of individuals among H R or H V populations and increasing the risk of human exposure to a zoonotic pathogen."
"Local weather conditions, potentially driven by global climate variation, have been repeatedly shown to influence the emergence of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses. Drought can serve to amplify enzootic transmission of St. Louis virus and possibly Japanese encephalitis and Ebola viruses, ultimately placing humans at higher risk for spillover. The converse, excessive rainfall, can increase breeding populations of H V s, driving enzootic transmission levels of western equine encephalomyelitis virus, Ross River virus, and Rift Valley fever virus to heightened levels, and ultimately increasing zoonotic virus spillover to humans."
"Mosquito-borne viral diseases have resulted from the introduction of exotic viruses into indigenous local populations of mosquitoes previously not involved as vectors, in addition to the establishment and spread of exotic mosquito species harboring viruses into new geographic locations."
"Ecology and economic development also play important contributing roles in this risk dynamic. Regions around the equator receive more direct sunlight than less-equatorial regions, thereby increasing the ability of plants to survive. This proliferation in primary energy production through plant life results in higher levels of biodiversity throughout ecological food webs in tropical regions. Specifically, this can result in an environment with a higher presence of parasites (organisms associated with many NTDs) and their vectors that ultimately infect human hosts. Favorable weather conditions with high levels of heat and humidity in these regions provide an environment conducive to existing NTD parasitism, as they are similar to the environments in which the coevolutionary relationships between parasites and their environment were originally formed."
"Mosquito prevalence is highly dependent on precipitation levels that promote mosquito breeding sites and appropriate temperatures for survivability. Conditions favoring mosquito capacity to transmit infections, for example, malaria, are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and other endemic regions of the world and are attributed to the high rates of morbidity and mortality from these infections. However, these factors can fluctuate as the climate changes in areas bordering regions where parasitic diseases are endemic and put the communities there at risk. Certain diseases will cause even greater threats when they move to new areas because the people there will lack acquired immunity and experience more serious clinical disease."
"Ecological and environmental factors act at each transition, modifying the likelihood of species contact, influencing the potential for cross-species virus transmission, and enhancing or retarding disease spread. Seasonal migrations of birds introduce WNV and alter the population densities of HRs. Warmer temperatures may shorten the prerequisite extrinsic incubation period of arboviruses in vectors. Local rainfall or snowmelt influence vector breeding success and global climatic factors, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, affect regional weather patterns modifying species interactions at different trophic levels. Droughts may force aggregation of wildlife reservoir hosts and vectors, enhancing opportunities for virus transmission."
