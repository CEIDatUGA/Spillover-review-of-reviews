"Most of the viral agents in EID are RNA viruses that have high mutation rates. This leads to their rapid evolution and environmental adaptability, so that RNA viruses can reach adaptive equilibrium within their host species very rapidly."
"The basis for the development of insecticide- and drug resistance is complex. Major factors involved include selection, the development of genetic mutations, and extensive and improper drug use. Population and vector movement, among other factors, are involved in the emergence of drug-resistant vectors and pathogens. Insecticide and drug resistance of vectors and parasites are powerful drivers for the re-emergence and upsurgence of diseases"
"Switching to a new rodent host can have a profound effect on virus evolution. Adaptation of hantaviruses to new hosts can stimulate the development of new virus phenotypes and hence expansion into new ecological niches. Examples of this include the divergence of Saaremaa virus from Dobrava virus: Nemirov et al. have suggested this has been the consequence of Dobrava virus switching from yellow-striped field mouse (Apodemusflavicollis) to A. agrarius, the striped field mouse. The result is a virus with presumed reduced pathogenicity for humans. Other examples of host switching include transmission of Monongahela virus from Peromyscus maniculatis to P. leucopus, eventually giving rise to New York virus and the crossing of Puumala virus from Clethrionomys species to Lemmus species and onto Microtus species, giving rise to the Topografov and Khabarovsk virus lineages."
"Domesticated pigs have often been regarded as a mixing vessel for influenza viruses and reassortment of the seven viral gene segments presenting an opportunity for new human strains to arise. "
"Viruses must bind to one or more receptors on the surface of the target cell in order to enter and infect cells. New diseases can emerge when viruses evolve the ability to bind to either a new receptor in a novel target host species, or use the homologue of an existing receptor in a new species."
"High rates of nucleotide substitution rates exhibited by RNA viral genomes ensure that RNA viruses can adapt rapidly to changes in the levels of host immunity, the availability of suitable vectors and the ecology of any animal reservoir. Infected mammalian cells are deficient in the necessary repair mechanisms to correct errors in template transcription: these errors are preserved if they do not prevent the formation of new infectious virus particles. "
"Viruses are among the smallest nucleic acidbased replicating entities and possess characteristics associated with exceptionally fast evolutionary change: small genomes, short generation times, high mutation rates, large population sizes, high levels of genetic diversity, and strong selection pressures. Because viruses often lack nucleic acidproofreading mechanisms, virus mutation rates are commonly on the order of 103106 per nucleotide each time the genome is copied. Given the small sizes of viral genomes (typically ~1030 kb), viruses with high mutation rates can generate genetically different progeny each time the genome is replicated. This error-prone replication can produce viral quasispecies (i.e., vast populations of closely related genotypes). Although sequence spaces are unfathomably large (the sequence space of a 10-kb virus genome is 410,000), the immense virus populations can contain many alternative variants; thus, viruses can rapidly sample sequence space and locate high fitness combinations of mutations. The quasispecies nature of viruses may facilitate virus emergence. The initial gain-of-function mutations permitting infection of novel hosts tend to be associated with host entry, namely the binding of the virus to a specific molecule on the host cell's surface. In many cases, changes in cell tropism can be accomplished through a few (or even one) nucleotide substitutions."
"The small number of mutations required to shift hosts has significant implications for virus emergence. Given small viral genomes and large population sizes, the number of potential host range mutants in a sample can be surprisingly large. A 10-kb genome has a maximum of 3  104 potential independent single mutants, which is well below the average population size of viruses. Given that a considerable proportion of these mutants are not biologically feasible owing to lethal mutations, two or three rounds of replication of a single virus can generate every possible viable mutation one step away from the parental genotype."
"Virus host shifts can also occur via large-scale genomic rearrangements among related viruses, that is, through the recombination of homologous genetic sequences, the acquisition of nonhomologous sequences (i.e., illegitimate recombination), or the reassortment of virus genome segments. Recombination is relatively common among the DNA viruses. While recombination frequencies vary considerably, some DNA viruses have extremely high rates of recombination. In one study of cauliflower mosaic virus, 53.8% of the genomes recovered after a single passage were recombinants. In the brome mosaic virus, practically every virus is a recombinant. Nonreplicative recombination uses enzyme-mediated breakage-repair mechanisms, similar to DNA-based genomes. Thus, the function(s) of recombination in DNA viruses may be similar to the hypothesized functions of recombination in other clonal organisms. That is, recombination in DNA viruses may serve to repair DNA, remove mutations, break down linkage disequilibrium, and maintain genome integrity. Moreover, recombination may allow viruses to capture and use host-encoded genes to manipulate hosts and increase infectivity....Virus recombination has been shown to facilitate virus emergence. A recombination event may provide a host receptor gene with a new genetic background, providing the recombinant virus with the ability to gain access into a host cell without triggering host active immunity. "
"A virus can be said to occupy a position on an adaptive landscape corresponding to its host. An adaptive landscape is defined as a network of genotypes connected by mutational paths. This network of genotypes is visualized as a three-dimensional topology of peaks and valleys corresponding to the fitness values of the associated genotypes. The relevance of adaptive landscapes for virus emergence stems from the fact that most emergence events require a virus to significantly increase its fitness on the novel host such that between-host transmission can be sustained. When a virus emerges in a new host, it transitions to a new adaptive landscape. Unlike the landscape corresponding to its previous host, it is exceedingly unlikely that the emerging virus is preadapted to the new host; thus, the virus would need to ascend a new fitness peak in order to fully emerge in the novel host....Together, epistasis, pleiotropy, and genetic distance may help explain why, despite the ease of acquiring host rangeexpanding mutations, pandemic emerging viruses are relatively rare. These features of adaptive landscapes may explain why some viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), fail to emerge in novel host populations. "
"Evolvability is defined as the capacity of a population to increase its fitness over time in response to changes in the environment. Components of evolvability include high mutation rates, high levels of standing genetic variation, large population sizes, facility for genetic rearrangements, modular genomes, and short generation times, all of which are characteristic of viruses.5, 167 Since evolvability can be expressed as an organism's speed in responding to environmental change or, more formally, an organism's nonsynonymous substitution rate, viruses are exceptionally evolvable. Virus nucleotide substitution rates estimated through phylogenetic analyses typically range between 102 and 105 substitutions per site per year, although there is considerable variation in substitution rates. Viruses and their genomes show many signs of having been selected for increased evolvability, and this may be a consequence of the ecological demands placed on viruses to change rapidly. High mutation rates and rapid adaptation were cited as the primary factors driving the emergence of parvovirus in canines... The capacity for rapid evolution makes viruses especially treacherous, as they can quickly escape host immunity, host resistance, and antiviral treatment and can rapidly adapt to increase their fitness on novel hosts. "
"Since the number of viruses transmitted between hosts is proportional to its within-host growth, viruses that grow poorly within a host have a lower probability of being transmitted. This point is especially pertinent for emerging viruses, because they are expected to be poorly adapted to novel hosts. Because emerging viruses are often poorly adapted, within-host replication is reduced, and, correspondingly, the number of viruses released from the host is also reduced. This has two consequences. First, the number of viruses in transmission vehicles (e.g., sneeze droplets, fomites, etc.) is decreased, reducing the chance that they will be picked up by another host. Second, if a new host is encountered, the number of particles entering the host is also decreased, reducing the probability that the virus can establish itself in that host without being eliminated by the immune system, inactivated, or washed out of the organism. In fact, these effects are likely compounded during each transmission event in a vicious cycle, and likely give rise to stuttering transmission chains that eventually go extinct. In this sense, the population dynamics of preemerged viruses can be described by the sourcesink paradigm of ecology, which will be discussed in greater detail later in this paper."
"An enduring paradox in evolutionary biology is the harm done to hosts by the parasites that depend on them for survival. The impairment and/or death of a host would appear to be disadvantageous to the parasite that depends on it for growth and transmission. Early theory suggesting that viruses evolve to a benign coexistence with hosts has matured into theory emphasizing the benefits and costs of virulence (trade-offs) for virus transmission. In brief, every virus has an optimal virulence that maximizes between-host transmission. Increases or decreases in virulence will evolve insofar as they also increase virus transmission. With respect to virus emergence, the relevance of virulence evolution largely stems from the supposed mismatch between virus virulence in a novel host and its optimal virulence in that host. Since an emerging virus has, by definition, not adapted to its host, it is unlikely that its virulence in that host is optimal... We can speculate that many virus spillover events do not progress to full-blown emergence because of less-than-optimal virus virulence... Excessive virulence is not the only reason why a virus may fail to emerge. An insufficiently virulent virus may suffer the same fate because within-host growth is not high enough to effect transmission to a new host. In addition, the weakly virulent virus may lose in direct competition for resources with a more virulent genotype. "
"In many cases, novel species associations are unlikely to result in sustained transmission (R0 > 1). However, parasites may evolve to better navigate barriers to infection, reproduction and transmission, making disease emergence more likely. By dramatically increasing the dispersal of potential host and parasite species, humans provide the genetic diversity needed for evolutionary changes to take place. The likelihood that a parasite species will switch successfully to a new host may depend on how much genetic change is needed to enable infection or transmission; in some cases, only a few nucleotide substitutions are needed, but in others, much larger changes are required."
"Emerging pathogens are more likely to be viruses than other pathogen types and more likely to have a broad host range."
"From another perspective, disease emergence is the result of two sequential processes: a) the adaptation of a pathogen to a new host: as elegantly demonstrated by Antia et al., pathogen strains entering a new host population may initially have an overall reproductive number of less than one (R0 < 1) that leads to the extinction of the pathogens, but prior to extinction, some may evolve and increase their virulence to give R0 > 1, allowing them to persist and spread into a new host population; b) the spread of the pathogen into the new population."
"Different questions relate to each of these processes. How did a pathogen enter a human population? What are the characteristics of potentially invasive pathogens? These questions relate to the adaptation of a pathogen to a new host, and can be addressed by comparisons between emerging diseases and invasive plant and animal species. Invasive alien species are defined as species introduced outside their natural, past or present, distribution. Generally introduced by human activities, these species have adverse effects on indigenous fauna and are now considered to be the second most important cause of the global biodiversity crisis. They are also recognised as a clear threat to ecosystems, habitats or species, with severe economic and environmental consequences. Questions concerning emerging diseases and invasive species essentially address how an organism adapts to a new environment and then spreads. In biological invasion ecology, it has long been recognised that successful invaders are generally those species able to maximise fitness in changing environments, i.e. r-strategists (organisms can be classified according to their strategies to maximise their fitness: in a predictable environment, it pays to invest resources in long-term development and long life [K-selection] whereas in a risky environment, it is better to produce as many offspring as quickly as possible [r-selection]). Such organisms are generally characterised by a short generation time and high numbers of offspring and usually have efficient ways of dispersing to new habitats, e.g. weeds (as opposed to trees), or generalist herbivores (as opposed to specific herbivores). Although not expressed in such terms, emerging disease pathogens are acknowledged to follow approximately the same pattern, i.e. most successful emerging pathogens are ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (r-strategists, that are small, with a short generation time, and for which minor changes in the genome may change host-specificity), whereas helminths are considered to be unlikely candidates to jump host-species barriers (K-strategists, with longer generation times, and higher host-specificity). Likewise, endemic diseases are generally linked to a static environment whilst epidemic agents are more usually associated with changing ones."
"Microbes, like all other living things, are constantly evolving. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as a result of the ubiquity of antimicrobials in the environment is an evolutionary lesson on microbial adaptation, as well as a demonstration of the power of natural selection. Selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and drug-resistant parasites has become frequent, driven by the wide and sometimes inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs in a variety of applications. Pathogens can also acquire new antibiotic resistance genes from other, often non-pathogenic, species in the environment, selected for or perhaps even driven by the selective pressure of antibiotics."
"Many viruses show a high mutation rate and can rapidly evolve to yield new variants."
"Food-borne bacterial pathogens evolve in response to environmental changes, developing new virulence properties and occupying new niches, including antimicrobial resistance. Such evolution can be facilitated by intensified livestock systems"
"Mixed farming or transfer of farm waste to other farms can facilitate the emergence of a new variant of a virus"
"Pathogens are more likely to colonise new host species that present conditions similar to those associated with their current hosts; therefore, they spread more readily among closely related hosts"
"The only pathogen-related factor that can be considered to be intrinsic is genomic variability, and this is particularly relevant to viral zoonotic agents, and specifically RNA viruses: their enormous mutation rate is essentially a factory producing the species that are most potently pathogenic for humans"
"In the case of non-viral pathogens, environmental or human pressure can be exerted for selection of strains that are more virulent or resistant to available treatments (a characteristic that is also known for species jumping and is thus favoured by pathogen biodiversity), through the wide, often uncontrolled, use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine, and the non-selective, non-rotational use of pesticides (in the case of zoonotic vectors)"
"Holding different populations of captive primates together during transport or while housed at or en route to zoos or laboratories might result in viral recombination, potentially resulting in unpredictable, new strains that could otherwise never have occurred"
"Antigenic drift due to random mutations is a common mechanism in the emergence and spread of viral diseases"
"The intensification of livestock management with larger numbers of animals held in higher densities in closer proximity to other species has allowed pathogens to proliferate and to develop genetic modifications more rapidly. These modifications can affect both their infectiousness and their virulence"
"there is some evidence to suggest that livestock production may lead to increased antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. There are certainly many pathways by which drug resistant pathogens could transmit from livestock to humans, including environmental contamination by excreted veterinary antibiotics"
"genetic change within the original reservoir (whether animal or environmental) is crucial for producing variants capable of infecting humans in the first place...Examples include the RNA viruses that comprise 37% of all emerging pathogens, many of which only recently entered the human population (for example, HIV). Higher nucleotide substitution rates in these viruses facilitate rapid adaptation, greatly increasing the chances of successfully invading a new host population such as humans"
"The changes in agricultural practices, mentioned above, involve heightened concentrations of animals and housing in confined, often enclosed, spaces, as well as the production of large amounts of animal waste that may contain pathogens. Intensive agriculture with its focus on maximizing product yield can therefore inadvertently amplify the growth and spread of pathogens, the genetic reassortment of new strains...and the selection of antibiotic-resistant microbes."
"There is good evidence that recombination and reassortment events, followed by fitness adjustments through mutation, have played a role in the emergence and re-emergence of new viral pathogens. In fact, most (but not all) emergences and re-emergences of human viral diseases, that have amounted to about one per year during the last decades, have been associated with RNA viruses that display active recombination or reassortment."
"(viral variation) + (changing ecology) + (travel and transport) = (increased opportunities for viral emergence)"
"Viruses generally have multiple genes involved in cellular tropism and host range, that encode non-structural or structural viral proteins. Modification of such genes by mutation or their acquisition by recombination or reassortment opens the way to a change in host range and to disease emergence."
"a reasonable working hypothesis...is that genetic variation in nonhuman pathogen populations does occasionally and incidentally produce human infective variants, and this explains why so many novel human pathogens are RNA viruses. This idea is further supported by the observation that RNA viruses tend to have broader host ranges than DNA viruses, implying that they can more easily adapt to new host species."
"pathogens that are already capable of exploiting a range of different hosts species are more likely to have the potential to infect us"
"For many zoonotic pathogens, contact with wildlife reservoirs and vectors is a key risk. This is in part because host-jumpingthe process by which a pathogen infects a novel hostamong humans, domestic animals and wildlife is more likely when human activities occur in or near wildlife areas, creating opportunities for jumps to occur. For vector-borne diseases, this can include exposure to vectors that can switch between wildlife and humans. This includes human activities such as wildlife trade and environmental changes that may favour contacts between susceptible humans and infectious agents and/or their hosts"
"If risk is a function of contact frequency and probability of successful adaptation to human beings, pathogens acquired from other primates might already be better adapted to successful transmission than those from other mammals"
"emerging pathogens often have a broad host range. Pathogens that are more able to undergo successful transmission between different host taxa are also more likely to infect human beings than are those less able to transmit between different host taxa"
"Spillover or epidemic infections have occurred between hosts that are closely or distantly related, and no rule appears to predict the susceptibility of a new host...Viral host switches between closely related species (e.g., between species within genera) may also be limited by cross-immunity to related pathogens or by innate immune resistance to related viral groups."
"The initial viral interaction with cells of a new host is a critical step in determining host specificity, and changes in receptor binding often play a role in host transfer...Gaining the ability to bind the new receptor effectively may be a complex process and require multiple changes in the virus."
"Since the initial infection of individuals of the alternative host is a key step in viral emergence, the preexisting host range of a virus has been thought to influence its ability to become established in a new host. Generalist viruses, which infect many different hosts, might be expected to show an increased likelihood of shifting to additional hosts, as they can already use the host cell mechanisms of many hosts to infect and replicate. In contrast, specialist viruses, which naturally infect only one or a few closely related hosts, appear likely to be more strongly restricted by the different receptors and replication mechanisms in newly encountered hosts. However, both generalist and specialist viruses are known to have become established successfully in new hosts, suggesting that there is no generalization that can be made about the likelihood of either type of virus infecting a previously resistant host to create a new epidemic pathogen"
"in other cases emergence requires the evolution of the virus to allow efficient infection and transmission within the new host. The evolution of viruses to allow adaptation to new hosts is still not well understood. The level of genetic variation is important, and most viruses transferred to new hosts are poorly adapted, replicate poorly, and are inefficiently transmitted, so that the greater the rate of variation the more likely a virus is to adapt to the new host. This indicates that cross-species transmission should be more common in rapidly evolving viruses"
"That RNA viruses seem to possess inherently more emergibility than DNA viruses has usually been put down to their very rapid rates of evolutionary change. RNA viruses are thought to evolve many logs faster than DNA viruses because of a combination of highly error-prone replication with RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase, large population sizes, and rapid replication rates. In turn, a rapid rate of evolutionary change allows RNA viruses to quickly generate the mutations that might be required to adapt them to new environments, including new host species."
"Because all viruses have an absolute dependence on host cellular machinery for a productive life cycle, the interaction between viral proteins and the cellular receptors of host cells makes up a large part of the viruses fitness landscape. We would therefore expect the interaction between specific viral sequences and cellular receptors to be of particular importance in determining why some RNA viruses are more often associated with cross-species transmission than others"
"The intimacy of the relationship between virus and cell receptor also predicts that generalist viruses, which infect a broad range of cellular receptors, are more able to cross species boundaries than specialist viruses that have a narrower tropism. Strikingly, provisional analyses suggest that this is indeed the case, as viruses that utilize conserved cell receptors are more able to jump species boundaries than viruses that use divergent cell receptors"
"Another factor that might influence the ability of viruses to cross species boundaries is the mode of transmission. It is easy to imagine how certain types of transmission mechanismparticularly respiratory and vector-borne transmissionmight more readily facilitate viral emergence than others. In both these cases, the probability of exposure to an emergent virus is relatively high compared to viruses that are blood-borne or sexually transmitted"
"The next question that arises is whether some viruses are more able to jump species boundaries than others. The most compelling idea in this context is that there are phylogenetic constraints to this process, such that the more closely related the host species in question, the greater the chance of successful cross-species transmission...there is no evidence that the viruses that infect humans come from organisms as divergent as plants, fish, reptiles, or amphibians...Rather, the majority of human viruses are of mammalian origin, with an occasional few coming from birds...There are also good mechanistic reasons for believing that there is a relationship between phylogenetic distance and the likelihood of viral emergence. In particular, if, as argued above, the ability to recognize and infect host cells is a key component of cross-species transmission, then phylogenetically related host species are more likely to share related cell receptors. Given the pace at which RNA viruses evolve, it is easy to see that highly dependent relationships between viruses and cell receptors will be quickly established, so that the probability of successful cross-species transmission will decrease with increasing phylogenetic distance."
"Although the engine of RNA virus evolution is undoubtedly their high mutation rate, there is mounting evidence that the genetic variability observed in RNA virus populations can be shaped, in part, by recombination. Further, because recombination is a process that potentially increases fitness by creating advantageous genotypes and removing deleterious mutations, it might also be supposed that it can assist the process of emergence."
"Other viruses...may need multiple genetic changes to adapt successfully to humans as a new host species; these changes might include differential receptor usage, enhanced replication, evasion of innate and adaptive host immune defenses, and/or increased efficiency of transmission."
"Antimicrobial resistance has been considered to be an EID. The easy acquisition of antibiotics and their incorrect and abusive use play an important role in the increase of bacterial resistance to these antimicrobial agents. In addition, resistance can be spread to bacteria belonging to the same or different species by mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons, or integrons."
"Drug resistance, another factor causing microbial and viral re-emergence, may result from mutation (for example, in the case of viruses and M. tuberculosis), or from bacterial acquisition of extraneous genes through transformation or infection with plasmids."
"One of the factors enabling viruses to cross the species barrier is their potential to adapt rapidly to a changing environment via their high genetic variability."
"To cause disease in a new host species, the pathogen has to jump the species barrier between the zoonotic pool (the animal host) and humans or vice versa. RNA viruses are associated with all known mechanisms of generating genetic variation to ensure their survival (mutation, recombination, genome segment reassortment). They show extremely high mutation rates resulting from a high RNA polymerase error rate and the apparent absence of any error correction or proofreading mechanism. As a result of this high mutation rate, RNA virus populations consist of a dynamic swarm of mutants, called viral quasispecies, even within a single host individual. The advantage of maintaining such a genetically highly diverse population becomes obvious when the virus is introduced into a new environment, like a new host species. In this case, a mutant might be present in the population that already shows a high level of fitness in the new environment and is capable of adapting rapidly to the new host."
"Zoonotic agents can also be spread from wildlife to humans indirectly by contaminated food and water, for example Salmonella spp. and Leptospira spp."
"Many zoonoses with a wildlife origin are spread through insect vectors. For example, mosquitoes are well-known vectors of several wildlife zoonoses, such as Rift Valley fever, equine encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis. Y. pestis can be spread by fleas, Bacillus anthracis spores by flies, and Leishmania by sand-flies, whereas ticks are essential in the spread of Borrelia burgdorferi and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma."
"For an animal pathogen to become a successful human pathogen, it must evolve into a pathogen capable of not only infecting humans, but maintaining long-term human-to-human transmission without the need for reintroduction from the original animal host."
"The species of animal that harbors the pathogen, the nature of human interaction with that animal, and the frequency of these interactions all likely modulate the risk of zoonotic transmission. Understanding this complex process will be important to combating future disease emergence. Therefore, further investigation into the interactions that humans have with animals (as a potential reservoir of disease), and conditions that influence this interaction, is warranted. As an example, despite the fact that chimpanzees have an extremely small population size and human contact with them is infrequent, their close phylogenetic relationship to our own species likely played an important role in our acquiring HIV from chimpanzees, as did the nature of our relationship with them. Presumably, the odds of contracting HIV would have been much lower had humans not been engaged in hunting chimpanzees, a practice that offers many opportunities for exposure to zoonotic agents through contact with biological fluids and tissue."
"Other factors are also thought to have the potential to influence zoonotic disease emergence. For instance, the loss of biodiversity is believed to be an important contributing factor to zoonosis, and studies conducted in the Congo Basin and Rift Valley suggest that deforestation and climate change play important roles in the risk of zoonotic transmission from wildlife to humans. Likewise, deforestation and climate change are hypothesized to have been causal events that led to the 1998 emergence of Nipah virus from fruit bats to pig livestock and, subsequently, to the farm workers within the Kinta district of Perak state in Peninsular Malaysia, resulting in hundreds of reported cases of acute viral encephalitis."
"For pathogens that establish in new species, the emergence process involves multiple steps, including the initial invasion into the new host (spillover), the production of transmission stages within the new host, and the establishment of the pathogen in the host population as a whole. The effect of biodiversity may vary for each of these steps. For the initial invasion, biodiversity may act as a source pool. This hypothesis is supported by surveys of emerging diseases of humans: most are zoonoticjumping to humans from other vertebrate animals. In one recent analysis, the probability of emergence of pathogens from wildlife to humans was positively correlated with mammalian wildlife species richness when data were corrected for reporting bias."
"New or emerging virulence traits can evolve and result in large-scale transmission and concomitant alteration of pathogenicity. This new pathogenicity may include increased invasiveness, enhanced spread, toxin production, or antimicrobial drug resistance. "
"Evolutionary changes are not always a prerequisite for viral emergence in a new host. Some viruses (e.g., poxviruses), have a wide host range and show a relatively low mutation rate. However, in other viruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, evolutionary change is essential for efficient infection and transmission to new hosts. Because most viruses replicate poorly when transferred to new hosts, greater variation is more likely to assist viral adaptation to its new host."
"Many viruses are transmitted to animals and humans from arthropod vectors. West Nile, Chikungunya and Yellow Fever viruses are examples of arthropod-borne viruses that have jumped to new mosquito species. In particular, flying insects can greatly expand viral access to bird, wildlife and human hosts. "
"The ecologic process of zoonotic disease emergence can be schematized by four transition stages (Fig. 1 ), of which only the first two are prerequisites for emergence: (1) contact between infectious propagules originating from the wildlife H R with individuals of a susceptible H S and (2) cross-species transmission, a transition subsuming the complex interactions of the virus infectious cycle within the H S. These first two transitions may require a mediating host such as an arthropod vector (H V) or an intermediary vertebrate host (H l); these additional host populations are readily accommodated by the modular emergence schema."
"Intrinsic biotic and evolutionary factors enhance the ability of certain zoonotic viruses, notably those with RNA genomes, to cross species barriers. Viruses with high replication rates, high mutation rates, and increased potential for recombination or reassortment may more readily adapt to new fitness landscapes and become transmitted among humans to emerge as pandemic threats."
"Strong evolutionary forces may be in play in circumstances where zoonotically acquired viruses are intermittently maintained among small and sparsely distributed human populations where R0 may hover close to unity. In theory, virus evolution is affected by socially structured host populations, such as where some human populations are aggregated in remote villages, with limited opportunity for social interchange. Models of virus transmission which assume homogeneous or freely mixing populations are of limited use in such circumstances. In such settings, modest increases in the number of generations of human-to-human transmission sustained by a new virus prior to fadeout (Fig. 1, second terminal dotted line) improves the likelihood of virus evolution to a higher average R0, and hence emergence."
"Second, pathogens may develop novel traits while circulating in a given host. Key to these dynamics is that the novel trait allows the pathogen to unlock host resources that would otherwise remain unavailable. Mass rearing of animals and use of antimicrobials and vaccines may yield virulence jumpers with increased pathological or clinical presentation, pathogens acquiring antimicrobial resistance or escaping vaccine-acquired immunity."
"Determining the kinetics of viral replication, the extent of immune control, and parameters that might impact these, such as genetic variation, hibernation, pregnancy, or stress, may provide key insights into why some viruses are more likely to make cross-species jumps and why some of these cause severe disease in humans. Indeed, for many reservoir hosts, immune responses have not been characterized beyond demonstrating seroconversion. Further, population-level persistence of emerging pathogens in their reservoirs has primarily been investigated from an ecological perspective, and the contribution of the host response to determining population-level infection dynamics within reservoirs is unclear. Experimental studies will provide critical data to improve field ecological studies by identifying which age classes, gender, or status of individual to focus on in studying transmission events. Experimental infections will also form the basis for improving dynamic modeling of infectious diseases, which is used to assess infection risk and develop better controls to prevent spillovers. A substantial list of important biological questions remains to be answered through focused experimental studies of the interfaces between various reservoir hosts and the specific viruses they harbor"
"That RNA viruses are over-represented in instances of pathogens jumping into new host species is consistent with the view that mutation rates may play a role in emergence. High mutation rates in RNA viruses, and the existence of multiple variants within strains of RNA viruses, provide an enormous capacity for RNA viruses to adapt to changing host environments and to overcome barriers to spread of virus both within hosts and between species."
"Benmayor et al. showed that a higher density of susceptible hosts leads to an increased mutation rate and thus increased likelihood of viral host jumps occurring, while higher levels of interspecies transmission can lead to the adoption of more generalist pathogen virulence strategies. Although conducted in unnatural microcosms, these studies demonstrate that the characteristics of the biotic niche of the pathogen, such as competition from sympatric microorganisms and host-reservoir dynamics, can also drive adaptive evolutionary processes. Finally, changes to population size and immune status of the reservoir can drive an increase in pathogen prevalence, thus amplifying the likelihood of spillover occurring. "
"The profile of a virus successfully crossing the species barrier and establishing sustained intra-Hs transmission might include I) an RNA genome providing high mutability (N.B. the novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) provides a notable exception), 2) a genome segmentation permissive to reassortment upon superinfection, 3) a genetic predisposition to recombine, 4) a high replication rate providing adaptive potential, 5) a high transmission rate achieved by direct or vector-borne spread, and 6) virus maintenance among multiple-RHs (multiple reservoir hosts) indicative of high innate invasiveness. These characteristics reflect the evolutionary history of the RH and the virus. However, in the process of emergence, virus life-history traits derived in an evolutionary context now remote may predispose success in a Hs."
"Our thesis is that otherwise specialized parasites can shift rapidly to novel (nave) hosts via ecological fitting and that these host shifts play an important role in the ecology and evolution of host-parasite associations. Important implies that ecological fitting between hosts and parasites occurs with high enough frequency to influence host range dynamics and the diversity of species and interactions among species. Although no quantitative statement of this importance can be made, it is clear from the above discussion that shifts onto relatively unrelated hosts can be inferred routinely in phylogenetic analyses and observed readily in contemporary ecological time. These observations are fundamental for emerging infectious disease (EID) studies: EID arise when parasite species begin infecting and causing disease in host species with which they have no previous history of association."
