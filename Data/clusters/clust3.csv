"In the past few decades, accelerating global changes linked to an expanding global population have led to the emergence of a striking number of newly described zoonoses, including hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, monkeypox, SARS, and simian immunodeficiency virus (the animal precursor to HIV)."
"Ecological principles also apply at the scale of individuals. Infected hosts contain a population of pathogens that grows and evolves according to the same principles as a free-living plant or animal population. Processes of viral replication, immune clearance, and tissue tropism can be understood by analogy to ecological processes of reproduction, mortality, and dispersal between habitats. The microbial ecology of zoonotic pathogens within their reservoir hosts can be a key determinant of risk to human health. For example, feeding different diets to beef cattle before slaughter leads to different environmental conditions within the gut, and a shift in the balance of competition among microbial species, which can change the abundance of human pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7. The ecological principle of competitive exclusion is the basis for common approaches to control of zoonotic pathogens in livestock and poultry. Meta-genomic studies show that the community of commensal bacteria within healthy hosts plays an important part in defence against pathogens. Furthermore, disruption of this community through changes in diet or use of antimicrobials can allow the growth of other organisms, some of which might be pathogenic. This mechanism underlies differential susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infection and might also increase the risk of zoonotic infections (as reported for salmonella). This factor underscores the importance of study of the full microbial community within hosts (microbiome), and not just pathogens."
"If sites are poorly managed, increased populations can strain existing infrastructure, leading to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, improper disposal of waste, and a lack of potable water. All of these changes increase the risk of cross-species trans mission of pathogens, resulting in zoonotic disease. Additionally, new human inhabitants (recent immigrants) might not have immunity to zoonotic diseases endemic to the area, making them particularly susceptible to infection."
"the expansion of the human population into virgin forests could disturb the virus reservoirs and increase the opportunities for viral transmission from animals to humans"
"It is believed that aircraft can carry virus-infected animals or arthropods from country-to-country and continent-to continent"
"Adventure travel, involving activities such as safaris, tours, adventure sports and extreme travel, is the largest growing segment of the leisure travel industry...This type of travel increases the chances that tourists participating in such activities will enter into contact with pathogens uncommon in industrialized countries...The growing trend for adventure tourism, trekking and mountaineering bring more and more people in touch with wildlife habitats, where sylvatic life cycle of many parasites takes place."
"There are emerging patterns of movements of irregular migrants from less-developed parts of the world to developed countries in search of better opportunities. This mobility implies also importing different cultures...For this reason the barriers for human infection with parasites, which was considered to be geographically limited because of parasites’ adaptations to specific definitive and intermediate hosts, and particular environmental conditions, are slowly being breached"
"Phylogenetic relatedness among host species may facilitate more cross-species transmission events because of similar immune responses and cellular receptors, which appears to be the case for humans and other primates that share susceptibility to many pathogens"
"Agricultural land also provides an area where wildlife may overlap with human communities through “crop-raiding” (the consumption and destruction of agricultural products)"
"Human contact with wildlife in association with nature-based tourism presents additional opportunities for pathogen transmission. Ecotourism increasingly brings people into contact with potential reservoirs of infection"
"Human contact with companion animals represents another avenue by which pathogens may be exchanged between groups. The global trade in domesticated and wild animals as personal companions is staggering, with more than 1.68 billion animals traded in the United States between the years 2000 and 2006...Disease transmission is an often overlooked cause of morbidity and mortality from privately owned animals, yet pet-associated infections in humans are common"
"Globalization and the associated ‘open borders’ policy caused a remarkable expansion of trade and human movement. These are two major drivers for the emergence and spread of vector-borne diseases. Large quantities of goods are transported daily around the world allowing invasion of vectors through airplanes, ships, containers, luggage and by other means...Livestock, pet and exotic animal international transportation are also important factors in the spread of infectious agents and vectors"
"Suppression of the immune system, whether acquired by natural infection with immunospressive pathogens such as HIV, or induced by therapy as in the case of cancer or organ transplant, may change the distribution and spread of infectious diseases. Cellular immunity is most important in defense against protozoa and some bacteria, and its impairment may induce extreme susceptibility to a new infection, or allow reactivation of dormant and otherwise asymptomatic previous infection."
"Air travel represents a major risk factor for the global spread of a new infectious agent. It is estimated that over 100 million passenger journeys by air are made every year. It is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours. This is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence. Frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases. "
"It is not only humans that travel: the International Air Transport Association estimate that around 80<U+2009>000 wild-caught animals are air freighted each year, many being placed in holding facilities close to populated areas whilst in transit. Even mosquitoes may be carried. It is thought that West Nile virus (WNV) entered the United States as a result of an infected mosquito surviving the air journey from the Middle East to New York City in 1999."
"Wild animals held or bred in captivity have long fascinated human societies. There is an increasing trend, particularly in more affluent economic countries, to keep wild animals as pets. It is estimated that approximately 350<U+2009>000 wild caught animals are traded around the world each year, adding to the risk of potentially zoonotic infections crossing the species barrier into humans. "
"New World agriculture and food storage patterns further promoted zoonotic parasites by establishing environments for food pests and their parasites"
"Travel and colonization facilitated the introduction of disease to naïve populations."
"However, in recent decades, increasing global travel and trade, expanding human and livestock populations, and changing behavior have been linked to a rise in disease emergence risk and the potential for pandemics."
"Many recently emerged zoonoses originated in wildlife, and the risk of emerging zoonotic disease events of wildlife origin is higher nearer to the equator."
"A common feature of all these processes is that they are largely a consequence of human activity. The title of Schrag and Wiener’s paper ‘Emerging infectious disease: what are the relative roles of ecology and evolution?’ could actually be substituted by ‘Emerging infectious disease: what are the relative roles of human activities and evolution?’ In recent years, it seems that humans have probably been responsible for many emerging diseases through creating and maintaining the conditions for existing pathogens to enter, persist and develop in new host populations."
"The reason that most emerging diseases are reported to be related to ecological changes rather than evolution may also be a matter of time-scale: environmental change may have been the main factor influencing disease emergence over the last few decades because such changes have been fast, whilst evolution has played a major role in the emergence of diseases over the longer term. This does not, however, prevent evolution from playing a role in the short-term adaptations of pathogens to human hosts, and assessing the respective roles of environment and evolution separately is therefore unwarranted, as they are closely intertwined. One can simply view emerging diseases as an evolutionary response to (anthropogenic) environmental change."
"Zoonotic infections originating from wild animal reservoirs are generally associated with anthropogenic forces involving high contact rates with the wild animal host (e.g. rodents can be host to several zoonotic diseases) or biological invasions by vectors (e.g. West Nile virus, Lyme disease) or by the pathogen itself (e.g. anthrax spores)."
"The two possibilities of disease spread through high-density settings and through the global movement of people and goods are closely related. The term ‘high density’ characterises many industries in modern society, including agriculture and food production in industrialised countries. High-intensity production of food animals may allow a pathogen which is present in a small subpopulation to become more widespread."
"the effect of fertilizer use on disease dynamics varies depending on the pathogen, the host, the ecosystem, and the level of environmental nutrient enrichment (ENE), but parasites with complex life cycles, especially trematodes, increase in abundance under nutrient-rich conditions because their intermediate hosts - snails, worms, crustaceans - have increased population density and survival of infection."
"Intensification also requires greater frequency of movement of people and vehicles on and off farms, which further increases the risk of pathogen transmission"
"Culture, tradition, religion and geographical location govern the range of food we are exposed to, how they are cooked, the ingredients added, etc. and therefore will also govern the parasites that we are exposed to...Animals that some cultures consider companion, work, wild or domestic are viewed by others as important sources of protein; guinea-pigs, horses (Trichinella spiralis), dogs (Leptospirosis, Cryptosporidiosis) and a range of wildlife species are consumed by many people. Tourism, immigration and exposure via the media have increased popularity of different kinds of food and have broadened people’s eating habits."
"Exotic pets have been a source of infection from endemic regions to very rare or new regions"
"The construction of new roads provides access for human, livestock, vector and parasite populations...By providing access to forested and newly deforested areas, non-immune, non-protected populations, such as construction workers, loggers, miners, tourists and conservationists are exposed to indigenous and newly arrived vectors and their parasites"
"Adventure travel is the largest growing segment of the leisure travel industry; growth rate has been 10% per year since 1985. This type of travel increases the risk of tourists participating in activities such as safaris, tours, adventure sports and extreme travel contact pathogens uncommon in industrialized countries"
"Transportation vehicles can serve as mechanical vectors for the dispersion of pathogen or vectors"
"agricultural surplus was stored in deposits, increasing the potential risk of infection by contamination of the grain or other foodstuffs and by attracting animals like rodents, the natural hosts of various zoonoses affecting humans"
"Individual human practices that predispose to zoonotic infections have been increasingly recognized in recent years as means of exposure to zoonotic agents. Such factors are often consequences of globalization and the ease of international travel. A typical example would be the expanding industry of ecotourism: urban citizens of the developed world who visit developing countries or rural areas of the developed world and engage in activities such as forest camping, river rafting, or bat cave exploring, are prone to zoonotic infections"
"The increased trend for pet ownership results in increased exposure to zoonotic pathogens, particularly with regard to non-traditional pets such as lizards and primates"
"human ‘developmental’ intrusions need not be grand in scale to interrupt the balance of a specific ecosystem. Even simple road construction can have such an effect, through alteration of the hydrological characteristics and the ensuing creation of stagnant ponds that may act as zoonotic conservatories"
"today’s populations have not only increased in number but have also increased the speed and rate by which they move across the earth, enabling rapid spatial dissemination of pathogens. This is explained by globalization, which has led to a dramatic increase in international trade and commercial transportations, population migration and a reduction in travelling expenses, which has increased the number of leisure travels to exotic destinations. This is further accompanied by an increase in merchandise and alimentary products’ movements, potentially bringing with them tropical diseases"
"Additionally, since the 1950s, leisure activities have increased as a result of an increased interest in self-development enabled by more flexible working hours and higher wages. Outdoor activities such as hiking are now common and put the population at risk of arthropod-transmitted diseases"
"Global change is also altering routes of infectious disease exposure. Some of these new exposure pathways have little to do with changes in the natural world. For example, increases in global trade and transportation facilitate the rapid transport of disease-related organisms around the globe."
"However, many types of anthropogenic environmental change also lead to new exposure pathways. Land-use changes are often associated with nonimmune populations of workers moving into endemic areas where they are exposed to infectious diseases with which they have little experience."
"In a recent survey of 41 different pathogens on six continents, nutrient enrichment led to ecological changes, which resulted in increased disease exposure 95% of the time"
"The unprecedented mobility of Homo spp. together with their flexibility in habitat usage likely also contributed to the emergence of new pathogens following novel exposure opportunities...The migration of Homo spp. out of their African homeland similarly led to contact with species of new worlds and new opportunities for cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens"
"Increasingly complex farming and trading systems are being developed as industrialization progresses to optimize the production efficiency of food animals and their products. Intensive farming and the trading—both legal and illegal—of live animals and their products have resulted in the global spread of zoonotic and non-zoonotic pathogens"
"Tourism, immigration and exposure via the media to ‘exotic foods’ and the increased popularity of them have broadened national eating habits. In an average supermarket in the USA in the 1950’s, about 300 food items were available, whereas over 3,000 choices are exhibited today, originating from many different parts of the world where different species of parasitic zoonoses may be common. The rapid transport and cool storage facilities enable the survival of parasites in food as well as surface contaminants"
"The ever increasing number of tourists who travel from countries where some meatborne zoonotic infections have been controlled in the domestic and synanthropic cycle can be exposed by eating the same meats during their travels to other countries where such infections still occur."
"Pathogen pollution, the introduction of a pathogen to a new host species, population, or region, is a direct result of the magnitude and frequency of global transportation."
"The booming worldwide trade in wild and exotic pets, some of which is illegal, has produced an unprecedented movement of animals. This practice carries a risk of infectious-disease importation"
"Primarily because of the growth rate of the global human population, the developed world’s expanding appetite for resources of all types has led to dissolution of many ecological barriers important in the natural control of disease. More specifically for parasitic zoonoses acquired from wildlife, human intrusions into many wildlife habitats, and the reverse, have resulted in a shift in the interface between wildlife and people from often sporadic and fragile to more permanent and substantial, providing significant opportunities for parasite transmission"
"the data available give the impression that taxonomic relatedness is less important than ecological opportunity as a determinant of the reservoirs of novel human pathogens"
"As suggested by the IOM (2003) report, an important contributor to the ability of a new pathogen to infect humans is variation in human susceptibility. In some cases this variation might have a genetic basis...More commonly, phenotypic variation in the human population will be important, particularly factors which compromise the human immune system"
"notion that pathogens of our closest relatives are more likely to be epidemiologically successful in humans"
"The ease and availability of air travel, and the subsequent movement of a large number of people around the world as tourists or immigrants, will lead to more cases of zoonotic helminthiases occurring in nonendemic countries"
"A successful pathogen needs to possess the molecular machinery to infect people, invade human cells or tissues, replicate, and access tissues from which it can exit the host and transmit (directly or indirectly) to other people. Historical examples are few, and thus to quantify the relative contribution of exposure frequency versus phylogenetic relatedness to the risk of successful infection is difficult. Analysis of host–pathogen databases of primates shows that closely related sympatric host species are more likely to share parasite species than are distantly related sympatric host species. Although any pathogen from a mammalian (or avian) host is a potential threat, that exposure of people to novel pathogens from our closest animal relatives poses the greater risk to public health is at least plausible."
"as the host population increases in size, the probability that a virus will be sampled increases, although it is likely that additional factors, including prior immunity and population age structure, will also impact the probability of virus sampling."
"The similarity between human and nonhuman primates permits many viruses to cross the species barrier between different primate species."
"Ships represent a mechanism of microorganism dissemination. Most ships use water as a ballast system, and, for example, the ports of the USA receive about 79 millions tons of ballast water every year. In 1990, Vibrio cholerae O1, Inaba, biotype El Tor, originating in India was isolated in ballast water from five ships in the ports of Mexican Bay. In addition, cruise ships can disseminate infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, legionellosis (through hot tubs), or influenza."
"The development of transport and communication constitutes a remarkable factor in the worldwide dispersion of microorganisms. Ships, aeroplanes or other vehicles can disseminate vectors of microorganisms, such as birds and insects. When insects arrive in a new environment, they have to adapt to the new ecosystem and establish themselves—dissemination to adjacent areas may then follow."
"The main sources of intercontinental movements are migration, political refugees, cooperating persons, and international adoptions. Throughout history, there are many examples of the role of missionaries, explorers, wanderers or other types of travellers who introduced a human pathogen into a susceptible population. Population movements associated with wars or violent conflicts, as well as environmental disasters, can lead to epidemiological outbreaks (e.g. cholera and typhoid fever), which are the consequence of population overcrowding, malnutrition, unhygienic conditions, and basic medical services."
"International travel, tourism and commerce are increasing, and they constitute an efficient transport system for pathogens and vectors. The introduction of budget and low-cost airlines has revolutionized the travel industry, making travel significantly cheaper. The World Traveller’s Organization reported that the destination of about 40% of intercontinental journeys is an underdeveloped country. In 2000, 79 million people chose an exotic country as their destination for holidays. The SARS outbreak is an example of how travel aided the rapid spread of an emerging pathogen from China to susceptible populations worldwide. Tourists risk acquiring infections when they are in new environments, because they are exposed to illnesses for which they have no resistance. Traveller’s diarrhoea caused by different diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli strains is one of the most common infectious diseases imported from exotic countries."
"The impact of both new and re-emerging infectious diseases on human populations is affected by the rate and degree to which they spread across geographical areas, depending on the movement of human hosts or of the vectors or reservoirs of infections. Travel has an important role in bringing people into contact with infectious agents."
"Immune deficiency associated with AIDS, and with chemotherapy for cancer, immune-mediated diseases and transplantation, has contributed to an enormous global increase in the numbers of immunosuppressed people over the past few decades (probably more than 1% of the world's population), setting the stage for the re-emergence of many opportunistic infections."
"Translocation: The Introduction of Pathogens to New Geographic Areas. The Example of the West Nile Virus The unprecedented epidemic of West Nile encephalitis in New York in the summer and fall of 1999 demonstrated the ease of introducing pathogens into new geographic areas in today’s era of rapid transportation and mobility of people and animals."
"The movement of pathogens, vectors, and animal hosts is another factor influencing the epidemiology of zoonoses with a wildlife reservoir. Such movement can, for example, occur through human travel and trade, by natural movement of wild animals including migratory birds, and by anthropogenic movement of animals. For instance, infectious agents harbored within insects, animals, or humans can travel halfway around the globe in <24 hours in airplanes. Thus, infectious agents can be transported to the farthest land in less time than it takes most diseases to incubate."
"A final noteworthy point about animal-derived human pathogens is that virtually all arose from pathogens of other warm-blooded vertebrates, primarily mammals plus in two cases (influenza A and ultimately falciparum malaria) birds. This comes as no surprise, considering the species barrier to pathogen transfer posed by phylogenetic distance (Box 2). An expression of this barrier is that primates constitute only 0.5% of all vertebrate species but have contributed about 20% of our major human diseases. Expressed in another way, the number of major human diseases contributed, divided by the number of animal species in the taxonomic group contributing those diseases, is approximately 0.2 for apes, 0.017 for non-human primates other than apes, 0.003 for mammals other than primates, 0.00006 for vertebrates other than mammals, and either 0 or else 0.000003 (if cholera really came from aquatic invertebrates) for animals other than vertebrates."
"In the past, the risk of human infection with parasites was considered to be limited to distinct geographic regions because of parasites’ adaptations to specific definitive hosts, select intermediate hosts and particular environmental conditions. These barriers are slowly being breached—first by international travel developing into a major industry, and second, by rapid, refrigerated food transport which became available to an unprecedented degree at the end of the 20th century."
"Since domestication is linked to the development of agriculture, the close proximity of domesticated animals and the increased human population density supported by agriculture may have allowed herd pathogens to exploit humans successfully"
"In general, vertebrate specificity greatly limits the ability of viruses adapted to one species to invade similar cells in another, distant species."
"Changes in the composition of microbiomes are frequently associated with infection and disease. For example, corals suffering from white plague disease have microbial communities distinctly different from those in healthy corals. In humans, bacterial vaginosis results from changes in the composition of the vaginal microbial community, and this in turn increases the risk of HIV infection. Although changes in microbial species composition associated with infection are well-documented, few studies have investigated the effects of changes in diversity itself. In a recent investigation, patients with recurrent episodes of infection caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile had significantly lower diversity of intestinal microbes than did control patients. Correlational studies such as these, though intriguing, make it difficult to determine whether changes in microbial communities are the cause or the consequence of infections. But some experimental studies clearly demonstrate that increasing microbial biodiversity can protect against infection. For example, children with a history of ear infections given a mixture of five strains of Streptococcus were less likely to develop subsequent infections compared to a control group. Similarly, reducing microbial diversity within a host can increase transmission. When mice with persistent infections of C.<U+2009>difficile were treated with antibiotics that reduced the diversity of intestinal microbes, they began shedding C.<U+2009>difficile spores at high rates. In some of these examples, a rich microbial community appears to regulate the abundance of endemic microbial species that can become pathogenic when overly abundant. In other cases, high microbial species diversity can prevent colonization by invasive pathogenic species. For example, the more diverse the microbiome surrounding the roots of wheat plants, the more protected the plants were against invasion by the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, piglets raised in natural environments supporting a high diversity of microbes were more resistant to invasion by pathogenic gut microbes than those raised in more sterile environments."
"In contrast to emergence through host-switching, 20% of emergence events between 1940 and 2004 arose through the evolution of drug resistance. For these cases, biodiversity of microbial communities within hosts may have a protective effect; human use of antibiotics is thought to select for resistant microbes by eliminating the great diversity of non-resistant microbial strains and species that suppress resistant strains in the absence of antibiotics. Investigations using recent advances in microbial detection support this idea. Thus, reduced microbial diversity may be an important underlying cause of the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens; this too requires further investigation."
"Furthermore, continual encroachment of humans into natural habitats by population expansion or tourism brings humans into new ecologic environments and provides opportunity for novel zoonotic exposure. "
"Horses are now moved from countries in Europe to warmer regions (e.g., United Arab Emirates) to prolong the racing season during the winter. Hunting activities have promoted large-scale export of animals such as hares (possible reservoirs of tularemia and brucellosis) from Poland and the movement of potentially rabies-infected raccoons in the United States. In other countries such as the United Kingdom, pheasants are bred and released for shooting in the fall and provide plentiful hosts for questing ticks and increasing their abundance. Importation of pheasants into the United Kingdom from France was associated with introduction of a mild zoonotic infection (Newcastle virus disease) in 2007."
"Zoonotic diseases associated with hunting and eating wildlife is of increasing global concern. Bush meat is considered a delicacy by many and has resulted in its growth as a commercial enterprise. Tracking, capturing, handling, butchering in the field, and transporting of carcasses involve risks of cross-species transmission. Particularly high risks are associated with hunting nonhuman primates. The act of butchering is a greater risk factor for acquiring bloodborne pathogens than transporting, selling, and eating the butchered meat."
"Large-scale movement of persons, livestock, food, or goods is now commonplace and provides increasing opportunities for rapid spread of pathogens. Trichinellae in horsemeat have been transported across the Pacific Ocean and infected consumers in other parts of the world. Discarded tires provide new habitats for mosquitoes in addition to their usual ecologic niches. The World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organisation implement strict control of animal movement. Transport of animals can result in mingling of different species in crowded and stressful conditions. This mingling can suppress immune responses to persistent infections and increase pathogen shedding. Under such circumstances, susceptible species can readily become infected."
"Tourism has exponentially increased in recent years. This finding has resulted in increasing numbers of imported zoonoses, such as a variety of rickettsial spotted fevers, brucellosis, melioidosis, genotype I hepatitis E, tick-borne encephalitis, and schistosomiasis.A rapid increase in cases of African tick bite fever has been associated with travelers to sub-Saharan Africa and the eastern Caribbean. This disease, which is caused by R. africae, is transmitted by a particularly aggressive Amblyomma sp. tick; >350 imported cases have been observed in recent years. Infection sequalae, such as subacute neuropathy, may be found long after travel when tick bite fever eschars have disappeared. An estimated >1 million international journeys are made each day, and a staggering 700 million tourists travel on an annual basis."
"Many areas are now experiencing a reemergence of zoonotic pathogens, partly resulting from collapse of public health programs during political upheavals. Often, these areas increasingly appeal to those seeking adventurous or unusual holiday destinations."
"Changes in human demographics play an important role in the emergence of infectious diseases, either directly or indirectly by causing ecological changes. Human migration and trade, including the transportation of animals, has the potential to relocate pathogens long distances and thus introduce an emerging disease into a hitherto unexposed and therefore highly susceptible population. "
"The intrinsic genetic variability in susceptibility to infectious diseases within the human H S is further modulated by an individual’s cumulative life experience and history of infection by various pathogens, reflected by acquired immunological memory or, possibly, an individual’s ancestry and evolutionary imprint of prior exposure to pathogens. Furthermore, immunologic function and the susceptibility of individual humans to infection and disease are dynamic and vary with factors such as nutritional status and age."
"Perhaps the most influential and certainly the most infamous anthropogenic modifiers driving the emergence process have been those enhancing social connectivity through road construction, railroads, and, the crown jewel of rapid modern transport, jet plane-assisted travel (Fig. 1). Nowhere has the role of rapid transportation been more evident than with SARS CoV (Table 1), where a presumed focus of human infection in the wet markets of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, where live animals or their products are available for purchase, was transformed into a global health problem affecting 27 nations on every populated continent. The human SARS CoV appears to have been inadvertently transported to a wet-market, along with an infected HI or HR , on a journey destined to end with human consumption. Wildlife farming and an immense network of illegal national and international trade in wildlife has been fueled by human demands for wildlife products of unusual culinary or putative medicinal properties. These cultural propensities enriched the range of opportunities for novel host/zoonotic virus interchange, but alone, as with rapid transport of persons, would not have resulted in a case of SARS without the biological capabilities of the virus to readily establish spillover."
"Human invasion of new habitats and new environments is a frequently cited factor in the emergence process of viral zoonoses. Human intrusion into novel environments is regarded as an anthropogenic factor which modifies the likelihood of contact and spillover transitions occurring."
"Third, diseases may become established in new areas and landscapes, as a result of passive and/or active redistribution of pathogens, vectors and hosts. Two distinct types of geographic invasion may be further considered: pathogens increasing the extent of their geographic range (‘geographic expansion’) and pathogens that become dispersed over distances with saltation, across physical barriers in the landscape (‘geographic jumps’). A key factor in the first scenario, geographic expansion, is the suitability of the landscape for the disease complex to become introduced and established. Climate and weather and also land use changes may play a role as drivers. Geographic jumps are facilitated by international travel, trade and traffic, together enhancing the level of connectivity between distinct landscapes, and their respective host, vector and pathogen communities."
"The drivers of disease emergence in a novel landscape facilitate access by existing pathogens to host resources elsewhere distributed. More complex scenarios involve introduction of infected host populations or infected vectors becoming newly established upon arrival. Land-use changes and changes in climate and weather modulating host and vector habitats or environmental pathogen survival may drive a local range expansion of pathogens... Geographic jumps typically result from international trade and travel, including transport of live animals, food items, plants and accompanying insects, thus enabling disease agents to hitchhike and establish in novel places... Geographic jumps may also result from the active migration of wild species including a range of mammals and also birds, fish and arthropods, in the process introducing entire microbial reservoirs into novel geographic areas."
"The high degree of phylogenetic relatedness between human and non-human primates is thought to contribute to greater risk of pathogen spillover. For example, species that are closely related and share habitat show the most similar parasite communities, suggesting that spatial overlap and phylogenetic relatedness are likely to be important for understanding transmission in humans and in wild host species. "
"A striking feature of Table 3 is the predominance of risk factors that affect the contact rate, with local and long-distance movements acting to increase both human-to-human and animal-to-human contact. This is perhaps unsurprising given the unprecedented speed, volume and extent of travel and international trade today. More than 1.4 million people cross international borders on flights everyday and cruise ships now have the capacity to carry 47 million passengers per year. Although long-distance movements tend to be associated with transmission by spreaders to the general population, some types of long-distance travel, such as tourism, provide travellers with the potential to act as both samplers and spreaders, and some long-distance trade movements have been associated with increased contact between animal reservoirs (e.g. rats) and humans. Wildlife and livestock movements clearly also play an important role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, with the potential both to increase the incidence of disease in reservoir or source populations and increase reservoir-to-human contact."
"Inter-species competition affects abundance, evolution, diversity, and pathogenicity of a disease agent. These processes can be tightly coupled to their pathogen hosts and, in turn, the community dynamics of the system. Hence, the invasion of an exotic species, triggered by wildlife trade, transportation, or climate change for example, could cause food webs to reorganize thereby altering the probability of disease emergence."
"There are likely to be multiple causes of novel disease emergence, but the human-mediated transport of pathogens (often in infected hosts) or vectors across geographical or ecological boundaries, a process termed ‘pathogen pollution’, has been identified as a major driver of this in wildlife and also in plants. The anthropogenic spread of pathogens has been responsible for the emergence of a series of high-profile wildlife EIDs..."
