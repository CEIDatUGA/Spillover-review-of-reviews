6/5/2018 18:13,Hypothesis,1,"Transmission of pathogens into human populations from other species is a natural product of our relation with animals and the environment. The emergence of zoonoses, both recent and historical, can be considered as a logical consequence of pathogen ecology and evolution, as microbes exploit new niches and adapt to new hosts. The underlying causes that create or provide access to these new niches seem to be mediated by human action in most cases, and include changes in land use, extraction of natural resources, animal production systems, modern transportation, anti microbial drug use, and global trade. Although under lying ecological principles that shape how these pathogens survive and change have remained similar, people have changed the environment in which these principles operate.","(changes in) agriculture, (changes in) livestock densities and distribution, (changes in) agriculture",,,(changes in) interspecies contact,"(changes in) animal trade and transport, (changes in) global trade, (changes in) global transportation",,,"drug resistance, host switching and breadth (generalism/specialism), adaptation and evolution",extractive industries,"anthropogenic activities change relationships between humans, animals, and the environment, creating new opportunities for pathogen spillover"
6/5/2018 18:20,Hypothesis,1,"Domestication of animals, clearing of land for farming and grazing, and hunting of wildlife in new habitats, have resulted in zoonotic human infection with microorganisms that cause diseases such as rabies, echinococcosis, and the progenitors of measles and smallpox that had historically affected only animal populations through changes in contact and increased transmission opportunities from animals to people. As human societies have developed, each era of livestock revolution presented new health challenges and new opportunities for emergence of zoonotic pathogens.","(changes in) agriculture, (changes in) livestock densities and distribution, (changes in) agriculture",,"(changes in) human density and distribution, (changes in) hunting behaviour",,,,,,"land conversion for agriculture, encroachment","changes in human relationships with animals (livestock domestication, land conversion to agriculture, hunting and range expansion) led to spillover of animal pathogens into human populations."
6/5/2018 18:23,Hypothesis,1,"In the past few decades, accelerating global changes linked to an expanding global population have led to the emergence of a striking number of newly described zoonoses, including hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, monkeypox, SARS, and simian immunodeficiency virus (the animal precursor to HIV).",,,(changes in) human density and distribution,,,,,,,increases in human population have led to spillover events
6/5/2018 18:33,Hypothesis,1,"Changes in abundance of animal hosts can strikingly affect disease incidence in people. A decrease in the abundance of a preferred animal host can cause an arthropod vector to shift feeding patterns to human beings, leading to a disease outbreak.",,,,"(changes in) community composition, foraging behaviour",,,,vector transmission,,changes in reservoir host density can lead to spillover. example: decrease in preferred host can lead to VBD outbreak if vector switches host.
6/5/2018 18:35,Hypothesis,1,"Environmental changes (including anthropogenic effects) might change the abundance of a wildlife reservoir host, increasing transmission within the reservoir and the risk of zoonotic transmission.",,,,,,,(changes in) abundance and distribution,,,changes in abundance of reservoir host can increase risk on spillover
6/5/2018 18:43,Hypothesis,1,"Ecological principles also apply at the scale of individuals. Infected hosts contain a population of pathogens that grows and evolves according to the same principles as a free-living plant or animal population. Processes of viral replication, immune clearance, and tissue tropism can be understood by analogy to ecological processes of reproduction, mortality, and dispersal between habitats. The microbial ecology of zoonotic pathogens within their reservoir hosts can be a key determinant of risk to human health. For example, feeding different diets to beef cattle before slaughter leads to different environmental conditions within the gut, and a shift in the balance of competition among microbial species, which can change the abundance of human pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7. The ecological principle of competitive exclusion is the basis for common approaches to control of zoonotic pathogens in livestock and poultry. Meta-genomic studies show that the community of commensal bacteria within healthy hosts plays an important part in defence against pathogens. Furthermore, disruption of this community through changes in diet or use of antimicrobials can allow the growth of other organisms, some of which might be pathogenic. This mechanism underlies differential susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infection and might also increase the risk of zoonotic infections (as reported for salmonella). This factor underscores the importance of study of the full microbial community within hosts (microbiome), and not just pathogens.",,,,,,,microbial community,bacteria,,"changes in host microbiome/disruption of microbial community can lead to increases in zoonotic pathogens within the reservoir host, increasing the risk of zoonotic infections."
6/5/2018 18:47,Hypothesis,1,"Increasing demand for food due to an expanding global population has led to a substantial susceptibility of our populations to food-borne zoonoses. Pathogens in the livestock production chain are a particular risk, with repeated outbreaks from meat, eggs, milk, and cheese, or meat byproducts incorporated into foods as flavouring, oils, or stock. Globally, most types of domesticated and wild vertebrates and many invertebrates are foods for people; such foods are capable of harbouring zoonotic bacteria, viruses, or parasites.","(changes in) food availability and distribution, (changes in) livestock densities and distribution",,"(changes in) food preferences, preparation, and storage, (changes in) human density and distribution",,,,,,,increasing human population leads to increasing demand for food leading to higher meat and livestock production and higher abundances of zoonotic pathogens.
6/5/2018 18:50,Hypothesis,1,"The volume of consumption of wildlife products for food is at least an order of magnitude lower than it is for domestic livestock.

6/5/2018 18:59,Hypothesis,1,"Many foodborne zoonoses are enzootic in livestock (eg, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, and some helminth infections), especially in low-income and middle-income countries, and result in endemic infections and outbreaks of disease in people. Cultural and farming practices such as stocking rates, mixing of species, methods of confinement, and feeding, and lack of proper implementation of disease-control methods— because of weak veterinary infrastructures and in sufficient public–private partnerships to support and strengthen them—can serve to maintain or spread zoonotic diseases in livestock and provide a source of new infections in susceptible human populations. The techniques with which animals are slaughtered and processed, and how products are stored, packed, transported, and prepared at the place they are consumed, also enable foodborne disease outbreaks.","(changes in) agriculture, (changes in) agriculture",,"(changes in) food preferences, preparation, and storage",,,"poverty, (changes in) sanitation and public health infrastructure",,non-close contact,,"the way livestock are managed, slaughtered, transported, and prepared for consumption in areas where farming practices go un-monitored because of weak public and veterinary health infrastructure can lead to foodborne disease outbreaks."
6/8/2018 19:17,Hypothesis,1,"Many zoonoses can be linked to large-scale changes in land use that affect biodiversity and relations between animal hosts, people, and pathogens. Land modification, irrespective of reason, changes vegetation patterns, vector and host species dynamics (eg, abundance, distribution, and demographics), microclimates, and human contact with domestic and wild animals. All these factors are crucial in disease ecology. The effects have been well studied and described for vector-borne diseases such as malaria and Lyme disease. In northeastern USA, a historical cycle of deforestation, reforestation, and habitat fragmentation changed predator–prey populations and led to the emergence of Lyme disease. Prevalence of human alveolar echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, a tapeworm of wild and domestic canids, with small mammals serving as inter mediate hosts) in Tibet is correlated with overgrazing and degradation of pastures and the resulting increase in small mammal densities.",,,(changes in) human density and distribution,"(changes in) biodiversity, (changes in) community composition, (changes in) geographic overlap, (changes in) interspecies contact",,,(changes in) abundance and distribution,,"deforestation, environmental degradation, land conversion for agriculture, reforestation and restoration","large-scale anthropogenic land use change perturbs the ecology of hosts, vectors, and pathogens and can lead to zoonotic emergence"
6/8/2018 19:22,Hypothesis,1,"In tropical regions, changes in land use have been linked to the occurrence of Chagas disease, yellow fever, and leishmaniasis. Such changes are particularly intense in tropical regions where primary forest is opened up to mining, logging, plantation development, and oil and gas extraction. This deforestation poses a threat to global health because many of these regions are emerging disease hotspots—rich in wildlife biodiversity and probably rich in the diversity of microbes, many of which have not yet been encountered by people. Increased access to tropical forests for these extractive industries might increase the risk of zoonotic disease by changing habitat and vector community composition, modifying the distribution of wildlife populations and domestic animals, and increasing exposure to pathogens through increased human contact with animals.",,,,"(changes in) community composition, (changes in) interspecies contact",,,(changes in) abundance and distribution,,"deforestation, extractive industries","deforestation and extractive industries, especially in tropical areas with high biodiversity, can change the distribution of reservoirs and vectors and increase human exposure to zoonotic pathogens through increased contact with animals."

Because viruses often lack nucleic acid–proofreading mechanisms, virus mutation rates are commonly on the order of 10–3–10–6 per nucleotide each time the genome is copied. Given the small sizes of viral genomes (typically ∼10–30 kb), viruses with high mutation rates can generate genetically different progeny each time the genome is replicated. This error‐prone replication can produce viral quasispecies (i.e., vast populations of closely related genotypes). Although sequence spaces are unfathomably large (the sequence space of a 10‐kb virus genome is 410,000), the immense virus populations can contain many alternative variants; thus, viruses can rapidly sample sequence space and locate high fitness combinations of mutations. The quasispecies nature of viruses may facilitate virus emergence.

6/11/2018 10:58,Hypothesis,7,"Virus host shifts can also occur via large‐scale genomic rearrangements among related viruses, that is, through the recombination of homologous genetic sequences, the acquisition of nonhomologous sequences (i.e., illegitimate recombination), or the reassortment of virus genome segments. Recombination is relatively common among the DNA viruses. While recombination frequencies vary considerably, some DNA viruses have extremely high rates of recombination. In one study of cauliflower mosaic virus, 53.8% of the genomes recovered after a single passage were recombinants. In the brome mosaic virus, practically every virus is a recombinant. Nonreplicative recombination uses enzyme‐mediated breakage‐repair mechanisms, similar to DNA‐based genomes. Thus, the function(s) of recombination in DNA viruses may be similar to the hypothesized functions of recombination in other clonal organisms. That is, recombination in DNA viruses may serve to repair DNA, remove mutations, break down linkage disequilibrium, and maintain genome integrity. Moreover, recombination may allow viruses to capture and use host‐encoded genes to manipulate hosts and increase infectivity....Virus recombination has been shown to facilitate virus emergence.

An adaptive landscape is defined as a network of genotypes connected by mutational paths. This network of genotypes is visualized as a three‐dimensional topology of peaks and valleys corresponding to the fitness values of the associated genotypes. The relevance of adaptive landscapes for virus emergence stems from the fact that most emergence events require a virus to significantly increase its fitness on the novel host such that between‐host transmission can be sustained. When a virus emerges in a new host, it transitions to a new adaptive landscape. Unlike the landscape corresponding to its previous host, it is exceedingly unlikely that the emerging virus is preadapted to the new host; thus, the virus would need to ascend a new fitness peak in order to fully emerge in the novel host....Together, epistasis, pleiotropy, and genetic distance may help explain why, despite the ease of acquiring host range–expanding mutations, pandemic emerging viruses are relatively rare. These features of adaptive landscapes may explain why some viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), fail to emerge in novel host populations.

6/11/2018 11:27,Hypothesis,7,"Evolvability is defined as the capacity of a population to increase its fitness over time in response to changes in the environment. Components of evolvability include high mutation rates, high levels of standing genetic variation, large population sizes, facility for genetic rearrangements, modular genomes, and short generation times, all of which are characteristic of viruses.5, 167 Since evolvability can be expressed as an organism's speed in responding to environmental change or, more formally, an organism's nonsynonymous substitution rate, viruses are exceptionally evolvable. Virus nucleotide substitution rates estimated through phylogenetic analyses typically range between 10–2 and 10–5 substitutions per site per year, although there is considerable variation in substitution rates. Viruses and their genomes show many signs of having been selected for increased evolvability, and this may be a consequence of the ecological demands placed on viruses to change rapidly. High mutation rates and rapid adaptation were cited as the primary factors driving the emergence of parvovirus in canines... The capacity for rapid evolution makes viruses especially treacherous, as they can quickly escape host immunity, host resistance, and antiviral treatment and can rapidly adapt to increase their fitness on novel hosts.

6/11/2018 11:29,Hypothesis,7,"Since the number of viruses transmitted between hosts is proportional to its within‐host growth, viruses that grow poorly within a host have a lower probability of being transmitted. This point is especially pertinent for emerging viruses, because they are expected to be poorly adapted to novel hosts. Because emerging viruses are often poorly adapted, within‐host replication is reduced, and, correspondingly, the number of viruses released from the host is also reduced. This has two consequences. First, the number of viruses in transmission vehicles (e.g., sneeze droplets, fomites, etc.) is decreased, reducing the chance that they will be picked up by another host. Second, if a new host is encountered, the number of particles entering the host is also decreased, reducing the probability that the virus can establish itself in that host without being eliminated by the immune system, inactivated, or washed out of the organism. In fact, these effects are likely compounded during each transmission event in a vicious cycle, and likely give rise to stuttering transmission chains that eventually go extinct.

The impairment and/or death of a host would appear to be disadvantageous to the parasite that depends on it for growth and transmission. Early theory suggesting that viruses evolve to a benign coexistence with hosts has matured into theory emphasizing the benefits and costs of virulence (trade‐offs) for virus transmission. In brief, every virus has an optimal virulence that maximizes between‐host transmission. Increases or decreases in virulence will evolve insofar as they also increase virus transmission. With respect to virus emergence, the relevance of virulence evolution largely stems from the supposed mismatch between virus virulence in a novel host and its optimal virulence in that host. Since an emerging virus has, by definition, not adapted to its host, it is unlikely that its virulence in that host is optimal... We can speculate that many virus spillover events do not progress to full‐blown emergence because of less‐than‐optimal virus virulence... Excessive virulence is not the only reason why a virus may fail to emerge. An insufficiently virulent virus may suffer the same fate because within‐host growth is not high enough to effect transmission to a new host.

These questions relate to the adaptation of a pathogen to a new host, and can be addressed by comparisons between emerging diseases and invasive plant and animal species. Invasive alien species are defined as species introduced outside their natural, past or present, distribution. Generally introduced by human activities, these species have adverse effects on indigenous fauna and are now considered to be the second most important cause of the global biodiversity crisis. They are also recognised as a clear threat to ecosystems, habitats or species, with severe economic and environmental consequences. Questions concerning emerging diseases and invasive species essentially address how an organism adapts to a new environment and then spreads. In biological invasion ecology, it has long been recognised that successful invaders are generally those species able to maximise fitness in changing environments, i.e. r-strategists (organisms can be classified according to their strategies to maximise their fitness: in a predictable environment, it pays to invest resources in long-term development and long life [K-selection] whereas in a risky environment, it is better to produce as many offspring as quickly as possible [r-selection]). Such organisms are generally characterised by a short generation time and high numbers of offspring and usually have efficient ways of dispersing to new habitats, e.g. weeds (as opposed to trees), or generalist herbivores (as opposed to specific herbivores). Although not expressed in such terms, emerging disease pathogens are acknowledged to follow approximately the same pattern, i.e. most successful emerging pathogens are ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (r-strategists, that are small, with a short generation time, and for which minor changes in the genome may change host-specificity), whereas helminths are considered to be unlikely candidates to jump host-species barriers (K-strategists, with longer generation times, and higher host-specificity).

The biological products of this remarkably innovative region are now widespread and include plants such as barley, the wheats, lentils, and four of the major domestic livestock species (in temporal order: goats, sheep, pigs and cattle) (Fig. 1).

Given the pace at which RNA viruses evolve, it is easy to see that highly dependent relationships between viruses and cell receptors will be quickly established, so that the probability of successful cross-species transmission will decrease with increasing phylogenetic distance.",,,,,,,phylogenetic relatedness,"virus, host switching and breadth (generalism/specialism)",,

Several scientists have suggested that high biodiversity is causally related to high levels of infectious disease, both locally and regionally. Indeed, some highly specific pathogens are likely to disappear with their hosts. Nevertheless, extinction and biodiversity loss may have some counterintuitive affects on the incidence of some VBZDs. Extinctions will occur selectively with habitat and dietary specialists being affected first. Meanwhile more opportunistic, generalist species may not only survive but thrive in the absence of competition from specialists. In their study of climate change and altitudinal migration in Yosemite National Park, Moritz et al. found that opportunistic small mammal species (those that were short-lived and had more litters per year) were more likely to expand their range upward than were their long-lived, less fecund counterparts. The host species for most of the known rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever viruses that affect humans are opportunistic species. Although it is possible that this pattern is due, at least in part, to sampling error (diseases associated with anthropophilic species would be the first to come to our attention), the pattern could be the logical consequence of several characteristics of opportunistic species (high vagility, rapid growth, early reproduction, high fecundity, and capacity to sustain high population densities that are conducive to the transmission of pathogens) that would facilitate the evolution and maintenance of pathogens. Further, decreases in the species diversity of potential host assemblages have been associated with increased prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens in host populations both for vector-borne diseases and for nonvector-borne zoonoses.

For instance, among central Africans reporting contact with nonhuman primate blood and body fluids through hunting, butchering, and keeping primate pets, we identified a wide array of primate T lymphotropic viruses, including 2 novel viruses: one that is distinct from all other known primate T-lymphotropic viruses, now designated human T lymphotropic virus subtype 4 (HTLV-4), and a second that is similar to other nonhuman primate T lymphotropic virus subtype 3 viruses that had not previously been described as infecting humans. These results demonstrate that entry of pathogens into the human population via contact with nonhuman primates is an ongoing, dynamic process. In fact, zoonotic transmission of viruses occurs on an astonishingly regular basis.

Three recent studies detected strong correlations between low bird diversity and increased human risk or incidence of West Nile encephalitis in the United States.

For hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a directly transmitted zoonotic disease, correlational and experimental studies have shown that a lower diversity of small mammals increases the prevalence of hantaviruses in their hosts, thereby increasing risk to humans (Box 2).

Certainly reductions in the number of hosts can reduce the number of vectors and also their infection prevalence, but empirical examples are relatively rare, in part because the issue has been neglected, and also because all else rarely remains equal. For example, the loss of hosts can cause compensatory increases in the abundances of other hosts, such that total host abundance changes little relative to total host abundance in more diverse communities.

For example, if those host species most responsible for amplifying the pathogen tend to persist or even thrive as biodiversity is lost, then disease risk will consistently increase as biodiversity declines. On the other hand, if amplifying species tend to disappear as biodiversity declines, then biodiversity loss will tend to reduce disease risk.

Consequently, the very species that have traits permitting persistence in degraded and species-poor ecosystems are also more likely to carry high pathogen and vector burdens. A similar pattern may occur in vertebrates—resilience in the face of disturbances that cause biodiversity loss, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, is facilitated by life-history features such as high reproductive output and intrinsic rates of increase.

Although changes in microbial species composition associated with infection are well-documented, few studies have investigated the effects of changes in diversity itself. In a recent investigation, patients with recurrent episodes of infection caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile had significantly lower diversity of intestinal microbes than did control patients. Correlational studies such as these, though intriguing, make it difficult to determine whether changes in microbial communities are the cause or the consequence of infections. But some experimental studies clearly demonstrate that increasing microbial biodiversity can protect against infection. For example, children with a history of ear infections given a mixture of five strains of Streptococcus were less likely to develop subsequent infections compared to a control group. Similarly, reducing microbial diversity within a host can increase transmission. When mice with persistent infections of C. difficile were treated with antibiotics that reduced the diversity of intestinal microbes, they began shedding C. difficile spores at high rates. In some of these examples, a rich microbial community appears to regulate the abundance of endemic microbial species that can become pathogenic when overly abundant. In other cases, high microbial species diversity can prevent colonization by invasive pathogenic species. For example, the more diverse the microbiome surrounding the roots of wheat plants, the more protected the plants were against invasion by the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, piglets raised in natural environments supporting a high diversity of microbes were more resistant to invasion by pathogenic gut microbes than those raised in more sterile environments.",,,(changes in) susceptibility,(changes in) biodiversity,,,microbial community,,,

It has been suggested that by expanding ecotonal areas through interspersing human landscapes such as farmland and settlements with natural landscapes, anthropogenic influences can alter pathogen niches by bringing together humans, vectors, and reservoir hosts (wildlife or domestic animals), thus increasing contact and the risk of transmission. Such landscape changes can be compounded by alterations in wildlife species interaction and abundance (e.g., host ecological traits); rodents can undergo ecological release at forest interfaces being attracted to farmland and human settlements for resources and suitable breeding habitat, and human settlements might provide suitable breeding habitat for mosquitos and birds (important arthropod vectors and reservoirs for West Nile virus). Evidence for an association between disease emergence and ecotones has been documented for several zoonoses with wildlife reservoirs, including yellow fever, Nipah virus encephalitis, influenza, rabies, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, cholera, Escherichia coli infection and African trypanosomiasis. In urbanized areas such as cities, tangential variation in land use from rural–periurban–urban areas would be expected to generate a wide variety of ecotones on micro- and macrospatial scales.

Informal livestock keeping is commonplace in African cities, and often characterized by low biosecurity and mixed-species livestock being kept in close proximity to humans. Evidence from recent zoonotic emergence events in Asia (such as Nipah and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses) and the circulation of relatively stable zoonoses (such as hepatitis E and bovine tuberculosis) implicate a role for livestock acting as bridge hosts, epidemiologically linking wildlife and humans. While resource provisioning commonly leads to increased contact rates between synanthropic wildlife, humans, and livestock, pathogen dynamics are also driven by susceptibility to infection, which, depending on the nature of provisioning, can be increased or decreased by host physical condition and immune defense. ... Becker and Hall and Becker et al. also demonstrated host demographic, contact and immunological effects of provisioning on R0, finding that unless provisioning reduces dietary exposure to pathogens or strongly improves host condition and immunity, increased aggregations of wildlife species dramatically increase pathogen invasion success and long-term prevalence. Environmental stressors such as heavy metal and pesticide pollutants, characteristic of certain urban environments, can further compound these outcomes through their effects on immunological function. As such, resource provisioning is likely to increase host density (a key driver of transmission rates) and wildlife–livestock–human contact, making such areas important interfaces for disease emergence.","(changes in) agriculture and farming practices, attraction of wildlife and commensals, (changes in) food availability and distribution, (changes in) livestock densities and distribution, (changes in) water management",,"(changes in) food preferences, preparation, and storage, (changes in) human density and distribution, (changes in) susceptibility","(changes in) community composition, (changes in) geographic overlap, (changes in) interspecies contact",,(changes in) sanitation and public health infrastructure,"(changes in) abundance and distribution, (changes in) foraging behaviour","adaptation and evolution, host switching and breadth (generalism/specialism), immune evasion, prevalence",,

The name dilution effect originates from the mechanism proposed for the Lyme disease system; the addition of less competent host species (birds, raccoons, opossums and skunks) to communities consisting of highly competent hosts (white-footed mice, eastern chipmunks and shrews) is hypothesized to ‘dilute’ the transmission of the Lyme disease bacterium to larval ticks by these species, thereby reducing infection prevalence in nymph ticks. A suite of mechanisms has been proposed to explain how diversity (usually of hosts, but possibly also of vectors or microbiota, and measured in a variety of ways; figure 1) could influence transmission and result in either a dilution or amplification effect. These mechanisms include alterations in host and vector contact rates, abundance, vital rates and infectiousness (figure 1, beige box with star). For each mechanism, either dilution or amplification can occur as host composition and diversity changes. Anthropogenically altered habitats tend to have fewer large predators, smaller-bodied species, and more introduced species than undisturbed habitats. The traits of species, including their contact rates, their infectiousness for each pathogen, and their impact on other host and vector species will determine whether they are amplification or dilution hosts.

While these two perspectives both have supportive evidence, when and why different levels of biodiversity, host composition or changes to landscape depress or attenuate disease is probably linked to human interaction with different landscape types that are in different stages of transition.

9/10/2018 16:55,Hypothesis,85,"Sedentarism increased parasitic infection because of proximity of the living areas to source of waters and the areas where human waste was deposited. The contiguity of habitation to the space where domesticated animals were kept, created a cluster of disease vectors. ... The milk, hair, and skin of domesticates, as well as animal dust, transmitted anthrax, Q fever, brucellosis, and tuberculosis. Peridomestic animals such as rodents and sparrows, which are drawn to human habitats, are also a source of disease. Cultivation often exposes workers to insect bites, and diseases such as scrub typhus becomes common. Livingstone and Wiesenfeld show that slash-and-burn agriculture in West Africa exposed populations to the mosquito that is the vector for malaria. Environmental disturbances during the clearing and cultivating of land increase human contact with arthropod vectors that prefer human habitats and that carry yellow fever and filariasis.

Although no quantitative statement of this importance can be made, it is clear from the above discussion that shifts onto relatively unrelated hosts can be inferred routinely in phylogenetic analyses and observed readily in contemporary ecological time.

This suggests that counter-urbanization can spur disease emergence because occupancy becomes juxtaposed with abandonment, resulting in novel human-environment interfaces shaped by management release and infrastructure degradation.

The spatial coincidence of other factors associated with transitioning peri-urban areas include greater refuse, standing water, intensive land use and changes in land management. Many of these conditions reflect the fluid demography, driven by high mobility (i.e., immigration and emigration), of peri-urban areas. Parallels can be readily drawn between peri-urban and counter-urban areas, which highlights the potential for abandonment and infrastructure decline to drive disease emergence (Table 1). It also indicates that elevated disease transmission risk is not an accident of time and place, but rather the product of identifiable change.","attraction of wildlife and commensals, (changes in) livestock densities and distribution, (changes in) water management",,(changes in) human density and distribution,(changes in) geographic overlap,,"human displacement, (changes in) sanitation and public health infrastructure",,,"land use (general), reforestation and restoration",
9/10/2018 17:55,Hypothesis,88,"Biodiversity should not be considered inherently beneficial, particularly when considered without regard to community composition. Abandoned areas and unmanaged greenspace have been found to harbor greater biodiversity than managed greenspace, but unmaintained areas can proffer greater harborage of commensal pests, including pathogen vectors. Biodiversity thus can be an indicator of potential hazards rather than valued services. This sentiment is well reflected in management of abandoned or depopulated areas (e.g., mowing), which often aims to constrain rather than enhance diversity. Biodiversity may be deliberately suppressed when real or perceived risks exceed benefits to human health and well-being, and management interventions intended to reduce risk may iteratively reinforce (i.e., via species removal) rather than restore biodiversity. Outcomes of abandonment could very well run contrary to increasingly contentious “biodiversity protects against disease” paradigm, which emphasizes the potential for a dilution effect (and the related phenomenon of zooprophylaxis) to lower transmission rates in humans by diverting transmission to other less competent hosts. A dilution effect may occur if an increase in faunal diversity reduces the assemblage of transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts; thus the probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts declines and the abundance of infected vectors is also lowered. This assumes, however, that the total abundance of vectors in a system does not vary. Critics of the “dilution effect” paradigm argue that the likelihood of dilution or amplification of disease transmission depends more on community composition than shifts in diversity.",attraction of wildlife and commensals,,,"(changes in) biodiversity, (changes in) community composition, (changes in) interspecies contact",,,(changes in) abundance and distribution,vector transmission,reforestation and restoration,
9/10/2018 17:57,Hypothesis,88,"Zoonotic infectious disease emergence also can be viewed as a consequence of socioecological disruption of natural host-pathogen interactions (Figure 3), where relationships that regulate and stabilize relative abundance break down. From this, we can posit that heterogeneous or asymmetric community (re)assembly in times or areas of urban transition, particularly under conditions involving land use change, can foster disease emergence (Table 1). This is consistent with evidence suggesting that disease dynamics may be highly heterogeneous in both space and time, especially in multiple host and vector systems with varying competency levels, where increased abundance of a particular host (or subset of hosts) may result in amplification rather than dilution. The net effect of host diversity on disease emergence thus can become a function of vector versus host abundance. Due to the potential complexity of these systems, individual relationships between vector(s) and host(s) become crucial to predicting outcomes, therefore diversity measures alone may not predict disease transmission as accurately as other measures of community composition in counter-urbanizing cities",,,,"(changes in) biodiversity, (changes in) community composition, (changes in) interspecies contact",,,(changes in) abundance and distribution,vector transmission,"land use (general), reforestation and restoration, urbanization",
