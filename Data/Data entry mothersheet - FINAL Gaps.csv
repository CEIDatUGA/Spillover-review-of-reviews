On the other hand, if amplifying species tend to disappear as biodiversity declines, then biodiversity loss will tend to reduce disease risk.

Nutritional depletion may impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infectious diseases, and these pathogens can decrease host condition, resulting in positive feedbacks, or “vicious circles” between nutrition and disease transmission.

8/29/2018 11:15,Gap,76,"The contemporary epidemiological environment is very different from the one in which epidemiology originally developed. As many of the exposures are ubiquitous and pathways to pathology more diffuse, the epidemiologist's task has changed from simply mapping well-defined exposures onto specific disease outcomes, to one of understanding how contextual features—ostensibly external to the process of pathogenesis—create opportunities for the progression of disease. McMichael notes that the methodological individualism, the focus on the individual as the primary unit of analysis for social causation, which has characterized modern epidemiology, has led to less concern with social, structural and historical influences on health outcomes. McMichael's description highlights the structural tendencies of infectious disease in a changing field: ‘modern epidemiology is thus oriented to explaining and quantifying the bobbing of corks on the surface waters, while largely disregarding the stronger undercurrents that determine where, on average, the cluster of corks ends up along the shoreline of risk’. Risk-factor studies, a mainstay of epidemiology research methods, compare the risk for disease between groups within the same community to identify associations with exposures that are potential causes of the disease. A major limitation of this approach is that by focusing only on community members, it fails to link community risk to the broader political and social context within which the community lies. Although research on the emergence and spread of infectious disease has traditionally focused on the biological mechanisms of transmission, and more recently the importance of the environmental context of the pathogen and reservoir, the social undercurrents that inform human exposure and transmission have been comparatively neglected.",Holistic approaches
8/29/2018 10:35,Gap,77,"The effects of anthropogenic processes on the transmission of infectious diseases have gained substantial attention in the past decade due to the simultaneous erosion of biodiversity and the increase in emerging disease events. If these two processes are causally linked, then conservation of biodiversity might benefit humans by reducing zoonotic disease risk. However, questions have been raised about the causality and generality of relationships between biodiversity and zoonotic disease risk. A fundamental question is whether conservation interventions will increase overall human well-being, including impacts on the total burden of infectious diseases, as well as other effects on physical, mental and societal well-being.",Biodiversity & Community-associated
8/29/2018 10:50,Gap,78,"The drivers behind the Rondônia malaria epidemic of the 1980s were complex and multifaceted and not limited to the ecological system of the mosquito vector and the landscape, nor to the transmission system of the parasite and human host. There were important interactions between these and other factors including the politics of the time, the economy of distant urban Brazil, and the standard practices by the migrant population of home and road construction, subsistence agriculture and deforestation. The complexities of the Rondônia epidemic represent the norm for real-world disease systems, not the exception. Disease ecologists should therefore be prepared to address and study the importance of such drivers and their interactions in order to better understand the spread of infectious disease.",Holistic approaches
8/29/2018 12:11,Gap,80,"Despite the fact that most EIDs originate in wildlife, few studies account for the population dynamics of the host, reservoir, or vector, in contrast to studies of human populations and demographics. This uncertainty concerning wildlife health presents a threat both to domestic animals and human populations. At a minimum, those infectious disease agents closely linked to human health should be identified and subjected to intense study, e.g., those that incubate and spread disease or provide ecological services such as disease regulation and/or vaccine discovery. Identifying these key species helps set priorities for routine surveillance, as well as uncovering as yet unknown species that present a threat or cure.",Holistic approaches
8/29/2018 12:19,Gap,80,"In today’s world, the biosphere is undergoing unprecedented anthropogenic ecosystem engineering, ranging from land conversion to ecological simplification and extensive biogeochemical change. The impact of these alterations spans ecosystem nodes, edges, and pathways with profound ramifications for ecosystem services and resilience. As the modified ecosystems and regimes emerge, their potential to impact human health must be understood. Investigators have developed hotspot maps to characterize risk of disease emergence and threats to biodiversity. However, coupled socio-ecological models of risk have yet to be developed. As a network evolves, dynamic risk mandates continuous adaptive iterations to monitor emerging threats. The major drivers are direct anthropogenic land-use change, e.g., deforestation, agricultural expansion, habitat destruction, and complex indirect feedback from anthropogenic impact affecting biogeochemical cycles, e.g., nutrient cycles and climate change.",Land Conversion-associated
8/29/2018 12:25,Gap,80,"The Green revolution brought widespread alterations to global biogeochemistry. Accompanying changes in agricultural practice altered the agrarian landscape—an important habitat in terms of both surface area and productivity. In this context, biogeochemistry is particularly relevant to health, given anthropogenic modification of global processes. Following World War II, the industrial efficiencies of bomb factories were adapted to production of agricultural fertilizers. As a consequence, ecological stoichiometry was radically altered. In geological time, this is a short-term experiment and it is not yet clear what the long-term implications will be for global-scale ecosystem processes. Indeed, the fertilizers manufactured are typically nutrients that limit productivity. Hence it is inevitable that these will impact abundance and distribution of organisms, including disease hosts and vectors.",Land Conversion-associated
8/31/2018 13:13,Gap,81,"In recent years, a body of literature has developed the concept of the ecosystem service of disease regulation. While still controversial, and probably not universal [76], this proposes that natural biodiversity limits the exposure and impact of many pathogens, including those that are zoonotic, through a dilution or buffering effect, thus limiting opportunities for pathogen spillover from wildlife to people [77]. When biodiversity is depleted (usually by human activities), this ecosystem service is impaired and zoonotic pathogens are more likely to emerge, as has been shown for hantavirus [78] and for B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease [79,80]. Also, alteration of species complements (again, usually due to anthropogenic impacts), rather than loss of biodiversity per se, can alter infection dynamics and lead to increased zoonotic disease risk [81]. Our understanding of the interactions between ecosystem change, disease regulation and human well-being, however, is in its infancy.",Biodiversity & Community-associated
9/10/2018 16:24,Gap,84,"Jones et al. found that the emergences of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife and of vector-borne pathogens were not significantly associated with latitude, but that emergence events of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife hosts were significantly, positively correlated with wildlife species richness. However, this correlation was quite weak, with wildlife species richness explaining only between 0.8% and 1.3% of the spatial variation in emergence. In contrast, human population density, a primary driver of biodiversity loss, was positively correlated with disease emergence, explaining 54% of the spatial variation in EIDs. Consequently, whether high host diversity is an important risk factor for the emergence of zoonotic diseases from wildlife remains an open question.",Biodiversity & Community-associated
9/10/2018 16:49,Gap,85,"We are well aware of the criticism of the concept of “emerging” disease. Paul Farmer argues that emerging diseases are only “discovered” when they have an impact on Americans. Lyme disease was an object of research years before wealthy suburbanites built houses in wooded golf course communities that change the ecology enough, creating an environment that brings ticks and rich humans together. Furthermore, he claims that “emerging” diseases are usually presented as a result of human behavior or microbial changes. Even when researchers provide an ecological perspective for emerging disease, they will usually fail to consider them in a broader political–economic context. It is precisely this criticism that we are addressing in the analysis of epidemiological transition presented here. We are interested in the social forces that influence inequality in an increasingly interconnected world, and how these inequalities affect the disease process. Farmer's criticisms echo those made by Meredith Turshen a quarter of a century ago, in which she claims epidemiological models of that time focused narrowly on relationships between hosts, pathogens and the environment and failed to consider the cultural, political and economic complexity in the disease process.",Holistic approaches
